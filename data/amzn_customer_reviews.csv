Really good option for portability.
","
This laptop is very impressive for its form factor. Really good balance of size, weight, and power. There are many more powerful options out there, especially for the components used here, but for this size of a computer it does a fine job. The screen brightness was a major concern of mine when ordering since brightness wasn't disclosed anywhere, but to my surprise it appears to be between 400 and 500 nits. Far exceeds 300 nits, at least by my own eyes (will have to measure).Fans do shut off at idle and have a very low speed setting for small tasks. Makes for an excellent ultrabook and game on-the-go device. Speakers need tuning, it has thx software to deal with. Wish it was just good out the box but I'm working on it, I think they can be dialed in well.Overall if your desire is like mine, a superb build quality laptop that does lots of things right in a small package, and is capable of gaming, this is a good option. I'm keeping mine.

Excellent portable gaming laptop
","
I'm writing this review for anyone who's on the fence about purchasing this laptop - since I was one. I was really confused between my personal favourite Alienware and Razer Blade 14 Ryzen. I do love Razer peripherals - I use the Blackwidow V2 TKL and Deathadder V2 Pro for my setup. The decision was based on several factors like trading Thunderbolt for USB C, missing Ethernet port, external GPU for future upgrades. I'll just answer those questions and hopefully, it'll help someone. First of all, USB C is not a huge trade-off because the 3.1 gen 2 supports 10Gbps which is plenty for any kind of connection - high poll-rate gaming keyboards and mice, 4K gaming monitor and any docking station. I read many articles about gaming using a docking station, and frankly, if it is not an EGPU enclosure doubled up as a dock, none support gaming. You can still connect the gaming KB and Mouse over the USB C dock so that takes care of the major problem. I used a USB - C to DP to connect my Samsung C27HG7x 144hz monitor and I'm able to get the full refresh rate without any problems. The HDMI 2.1 port would also obviously work. I have 2 monitors hooked up to the laptop(the 2nd one is FHD Acer R240HY), a dock connected using the other USB C port to connect my Keyboard (for charging or wired connectivity), Razer Goliathus extended gaming pad (chroma), and my Fifine Microphone. I also used one of the USB A ports, which supports the 10Gbps bandwidth to connect my KB and DA mouse wirelessly (2.4Ghz). I don't intend to carry it around and essentially use it as a desktop replacement so given the above configuration, it is a pretty clean setup.Just to add - with the RTX 3070 in place, you won't need an EGPU enclosure anytime soon.I specifically provided the device names so that you can look up the specifications and ensure what is indeed supported if you were to look for a similar setup.About the laptop components itself, the screen is brilliant, the high refresh rate is awesome, the keyboard is also pretty good although I use my mech KB most of the time. But I just have to mention the glass touchpad. I use an MBP 13 for work and coming from that mouse pad I never came across a windows laptop that matched its touchpad quality. But the Razer Blade pretty much nailed it this time - it is absolutely brilliant. The feel is so premium and the multi-finger gesture (I use the 2 finger scrolling a lot) is just flawless. For other components, there are tons of reviews out there so I just wanted to mention this one thing that was my personal experience and I absolutely loved. To anyone upgrading or going for a new gaming laptop that also looks premium and does not scream gaming - go for it!

BEST 14inch Laptop in the World

I sold my M1 MacBook for this, and it was one of the best decisions in my life.If you've used MacBooks for years and now are switching over to Windows Laptops, Razer is the place to go, with Apple level built quality and fantastic overall aesthetics.The performance with my 3070 model is phenomenal, with the trade-off of fan noise and battery life.

This laptop started off excellent. Screen looked great, Track pad was great. Started to download a few games and the Wifi went out. The Bluetooth still worked but no wifi. Called razer, they sent me an email for me to troubleshoot. Then I was to email them with what I found out. Really Razer? After spending $2,100 I have to do your job. Will not buy another Razer. This laptop was in my possession for just hours. On its way back to amazon. Better customer service could have saved this.

pros:1) keyboard: razer laptops are still the keyboard I type the fastest on, also per-key RGB2) steady 100 watts, razer promissed 100, and it delivers, in game the GPU pulls a steady100 watts throughout gameplay. For comparison, the G14 promissed 80 watts, and even if you carefully manage CPU wattage, the G14 usually only delivers around 70 watts.3) even at 100 watts, the GPU temps never exceed 65 C4) battery life delivers: with updated graphics drivers, keyboard light off, screen at lowest brightness, and power saving mode on, I can get 16 hrs of video streaming on youtube. If you make some sacrifices and manage power draw well, this could be an all day battery.5) overall gameplay is really really good with very high 1% lows6) screen + touchpad are both low latency, which makes scrolling around a heavenly smooth experience7) CPU is 8 cores and can hit nearly 4.6 GHz. ""boost"" in razer synapse allows it to run at nearly 80 watts8) build quality: amazing. This laptop feels so solid in your hands with no flex whatsoever9) A breath under 4 lbscons:1) it does not come with the GaN charger that Razer has been sending to influencers with this product.2) CPU not cooled so well. I've seen it hit 100 C, and it often hovers around 90 in game3) RAM is awfully low bandwidth. Seems to work well in games, so maybe not an issue, but my RAM benchmarks have been pretty disappointing (especiallly considered it can not be replaced)Overall:A gaming laptop is for doing work, hobbies, and gaming with seamless transitions from your desk to on-the-go. For this, the cons I listed above are relatively small issues in the face of the pros which cover the important things, so I give this 5/5.

The Golden Standard

I was weighing my options between getting a full desktop pc and or getting this Razer. No other laptop even had my considerations. I work in the tech field as a sr. engineer and what drew me to this is the apple like quality. Well, now that I own this Razer I can confirm everything they say is true.Pros:1) Packaging is mostly (you can still tell its a pc) discreet. There is no indicator this is a high-end gaming pc.2) Internal packing is well protected and compartmentalized. Everything was packed with the highest level of care.3) Device and peripherals were / are flawless in appearance.4) Performance is actually good enough that I won't get a gaming desktop for a couple years. Instead, I'll get a usb-c dock and if needed an eGPU from razer. In fact I speculate the Egpu setup with this process would be an amazing combo since the heat buildup of the iGPU would be offloaded to external device.5) Very little if any bloatware.6) FPS in games like Cyberpunk2077 with everything set to Ultra (and pyscho), including ray-tracing, produces an average of 30-45 frames per second using native resolution. While in the e-sports world this isn't viable (but then again e-sports titles aren't competitively played on ultra...) , setting resolution to 1080 adds 30 or so more frames and turn set ray-tracing to medium with balanced DLS and you can above 100fps in games like Cyberpunk 2077. I, however, prefer to play on my ultra-plush eye-gasmic settings and in an rpg-fps 30 fps is very playable, especially with build in G-sync!!!Honestly, Razer did it. They compelled a desktop gaming nerd to buy their tiny, gorgeous, gaming laptop and I applaud Razer for all that they managed to accomplish when the brought this laptop to market.

A Small, But Very Powerful Device
","
Review is based of having the computer as a daily driver for a week. This meant all my gaming and media consumption was off of this machine. I have used this machine ""docked"" to an external keyboard and monitor during the day at my desk, and use it as a standard unplugged laptop at night.The TLDR is this is a high quality device with few flaws. The flaws I will mention are, admittedly, on the nitpicky side.At the end of the day, sure there are very many other laptops which can match the Razer Blade 14's performance and specs at a lower price, but that is at the cost of build quality. That will be very important if you choose to use this as a portable device. I highly recommend that if you wanted a high powered portable machine, you consider the Razer Blade 14.Pros:- Handles Next Gen Gaming at QHD Flawlessly.I am able to play competitive games at high - max setting with framerates around 70 - 90 FPS. Halo Infinite's multiplayer beta ran at such performance for my extended gameplay sessions of 4 to 6 hours. Other popular games which aren't as demanding, such as FF14, Risk of Rain 2, would stay about 100 FPS around the 120 - 160 FPS range. Basically, anything that has come out in the last 10 years can expect very high frame rates at maximum settings.- Great Temperatures.Gaming laptops run hot when pushed, that is to be expected. But this machine is able to maintain good temps while gaming for long periods. And when unplugged, I am able to use the machine for basic streaming and browsing without creating any heat.- Apple Level Build Quality.This is essentially a black Macbook with crazy specs inside. Everything feels really solid and sturdy. The device has a very nice heft to it. The trackpad is very reminiscent of a Macbook's track pad, which is a good thing. It clicks with good feedback and is very responsive all while having a nice matte texture to it.- Great Display.Nothing much to say here, the colors on the screen are very good and I didn't have much issue play games using the built in screen, though much of my experience has been through an external monitor. The screen is perfect for media consumption.- Great Battery Life.The battery lasts around 5-7 hours streaming media and browsing with some screen brightness down and the RGB keyboard at a dimmer level (I like to keep it on because it looks cool). Like all laptops, don't expect the battery life to be that long when running games or resource heavy programs like a video editor or compiling and running code.Cons:- Very Shallow Keyboard.Its a decent laptop keyboard but lacks the travel of other laptop keyboards  I have in the past and doesn't come off as very tactile. Not a big problem for me, who used it attached to an external mechanical keyboard and monitor.- Razor Software.In the past I would call this bloat but Razor has seemed to improved their software to be very straightforward. This is listed as a con because the software is very insistent that you create a Razor account to use it, and a lot of important features such as the fan speeds and performance tuning are locked behind the software.

Heat: It does get hot. CPU and GPU under normal temps, but the exterior top of keyboard gets really hot.Gaming: plugged or not, games have been functioning well. FF14, World of Warcraft, older games ran so far.Battery: Minimum 4 hrs on regular work use (communicators, chrome with at least 12 tabs open and 2 instances running, messenger, VLC for video playback). 6hrs at least for VLC or youtube only.Keyboard: Personal preference, but i like it as it is silent. Clicky enough but it is mushy compared to regular mechanical keyboards.USB C Charging: 65w charger takes 1.25 hrs to charge. Still haven't tested using 100w charger, I expect it to be around an hour as well. Laptop does prompt that it needs more power.Brightness: Really bright but makes me wonder if it can do better outdoors. I thnk its at 325 nits or something. XPS boasts of around 500 nits, might be great outdoors.Overall: Really happy choosing this over the G14. I wanted the G14 but it felt cheap and ""corny"" when I saw it in person. Again, personal preference and it may not really make sense to others.

Overall experience is great.Build quality is awesome.RGB keyboard lighting is perfect.Screen is QHD and very good. Not crazy bright but good enough.Performance is very good.Cooling in balanced settings is very quiet but if you crank the fans to maximum then a bit noisy but still acceptable. (could be annoying for other people though)CPU runs a bit hot (between 85-90) in balanced mode while gaming Valhalla in maximum settings (ambient temperature is 25) but in maximum fan mode temp. drops to 75-80.Keyboard is mediocre. Key travel is less and feels a bit mushy. Still not bad.I didn't measure the battery life but looks OK for a 14"" laptop. If you drop the refresh rate, screen resolution and the brightness you might get good results probably more than 6 hours.Very portable.Pricy but recommended if you have the budget.

I love having the ability to max out every game I want to play! I had two options; this laptop or an Xbox Series X. Seeing as I was more likely to get a free ticket to another galaxy than obtain a brand new Xbox Series X, I settled for the best of the best gaming laptop. This device does not disappoint! The build quality far surpasses the other manufacturers like Asus & Dell plus the 14"" size is perfect for those of us who travel for work on occasion. Sure the exhaust fans can, on occasion, make a little noise, but that's the price you pay for POWER! 🔥😎 Overall 110% love this laptop!

 I ordered this laptop to be shipped overseas. I not only arrived 3 days earlier (without Prime), it also came with excellent packaging. This reassured me that the parcel arrived safe and sound.Very simple and discrete design (you can even turn off the green logo on the back if you prefer).Super Portable, ""physically speaking"" it's almost as compact as my older Macbook Pro Retina 2015.Great keyboard and trackpad (they fit just right for my medium-size hands :P )Excellent Battery Life, I got easily +3 hours running CAD programs, +6 hours with MS Office and Browsing.I'm an engineer by profession, so the past week I've been using Autocad, Multisim, Matlab, Visual and it has stayed cool and quiet the whole time.LastIy, I played some online Steam games (casually - L4D2, Borderlands 2, Rocket League) and it was quite good, considering this laptop has  a high-spec. configuration. (**Note: I am no ""hardcore"" gamer so I can't really give a useful opinion on this area, it was good by my standards)Overall, RAZER WELL DONE!! You just got yourselves a 100% Satisfied Customer :)).PS: Since the screen comes with a higher resolution capabilities, by default i comes with a small font size (tiny letters :3). Though the font size can be adjusted on Display Settings - so no complains here (this is more like an FYI).

This laptop is pricey, but if you have the coins it’s a phenomenal purchase. I find the 14” screen to be the perfect size; text is still a good size, UI elements are clear, and overall it’s an immersive experience. I like the machine’s smaller footprint, so no complaints about screen size. In terms of performance, it handles anything I throw at it with ease. It definitely runs hot. Something I’ve noticed, though, is that one of the fans seems to sit right under the WASD keys on the keyboard. That area feels cool to the touch during heavy use. It seems like an intentional detail and it’s impressive. I absolutely love the look and feel. It’s sleek, mostly minimalistic (I could do with fewer bright green details) and overall it feels like a premium product. One nitpick is that I expected a more luxe unboxing experience at this price point. It’s a minor detail, so if you can’t tell I’m grasping at straws. This thing is awesome.

I was somewhat concerned with the cooling ability (RTX 3070) but lying flat, it runs in the low-to-mid 70's. WIth the Razer stand I bought it stays in the 60's on max.The screen brightness appears much brighter than what it's rated. And surprisingly the cooling fans are much quieter than I thought they'd be.Overall this thing is a total beast and feels great. You get used to the 14"" screen quite fast. Razer does have the best quality out of the other seven gaming laptops I've owned in the past.

It's my first Razer and I'm surprised at how premium it feels. I have an XPS 15 and this feels just as premium as that and the MacBooks with its unibody metal chassis. It also delivers insane gaming performance from a package so small. The 3070 model I have is only about 10% slower than the much bigger Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 with a 3080. The only complaints would that 16:9 aspect ratio, average speakers, terrible webcam, and the slightly mushy keys. Absolutely love the per-key RGB.

Brand new Razer Blade 14 with a broken mouse pad
","
Received this gem but once I turned it on I realized that the track pad was super jumpy and unable to control. I tried downloading drivers again updating windows and synapse resetting the whole computer and still was unable to use the track pad. I also called support, just told me everything I already tried…. I plugged in my mouse and was able to game fine with no problem. I was really impressed  with the small monster. Great size too. I just wish the Ryzen processor was in a 15in variant because the only thing the 14in is lacking in my opinion is a SD slot and a extra SSD spot (which comes in the 15in blade)This 14in was my replacement for my 2019 razer blade pro 17 and I honestly feel that 15in advance model is the sweet spot. I honestly would have probably kept the 14in if it had one of my two wishes. I am not a fan on dongles or external SSD at all. I like to keep my travel set up clean as possible.I’m disappointed with razer and would advise anyone to get the 1-2 year plan for $300. It’s crazy to me how a brand new computer costing me $2300 would have a problem out the box and my last razer laptop from 2019 ($2500 + insurance) battery died after 2 years?? I love this company but disappointed with my purchases.

Razer needs to deliver Confidence to their buyers.
","
Review is for the middle tier RTX 3070.the GOOD:  Excellent design, well built, no doubt that this is a premium product.  As a cohesive unit, this product delivers.  It does come with minimal bloatware (thanks Razer).I just wish Razer fixes the following...the BAD:1-  $2,200 is a lot of money for a laptop. I wish Razer has as much confidence in its products as its customers. Offering a 1 year warranty doesn't do it for me. Statistically, a part of this laptop will fail in about 2 years.  Since everything is integrated, there is no way that we can replace anything.2- 16GB of RAM soldered.  Razer: if you wont allow your customers to upgrade RAM, offer 32GB3- Some games (Forza, Dirt 5) failed.  I don't know why, but I don't want to have to find out why.  Again, for this price point it should work out of the box.4-Web cam. barley good enough to use it for facial recognition to log in.  Video and Audio Quality is really bad and would not use it in an office/work (from home) environment.5- The power plug--this needs to be updated to USBC 2.1.  Razer had an opportunity to do that with this laptop, but stuck with their outdated proprietary plug.  This would alleviate the need to have multiple plugs when docked , and lugging around the huge power brick.the UGLY:  overall I do not feel confident enough to justify paying about $2,700 after taxes and insurance.  A college freshman, should be able to pick this up knowing that this laptop will provide the performance, power, and confidence to last all his 4 years of college.

This is a great laptop with a few things that are just a small negative. For Background I returned the Asus G15 for lack of camera and not liking the screen and build quality. This machine I an very happy to be keeping since it has all these things even though the camera is not good quality. My only real negative I could say is the speaker quality is bad. The battery life is about 5-6hrs which is good for this type of laptop but not as good as my other laptops so will have to get used to plugging in more. The performance is crazy good for a 14 inch laptop. I got the 3070 version and think that is the sweet spot since the 3080 still runs on the same wattage and from reviews only gains max 10% performance which for 600 dollars more doesn't make much sense to buy. I am playing all games at full resolution and highest settings and this machine does amazing. I really like the keyboard and trackpad. Overall this is my ideal laptop- small, well built, and powerful. I docked one star for the poor speakers and poor webcam. Other machines have smaller bezels than this one and do these 2 things way better so they could have easily done better in these 2 ways. But the rest of the laptop is so good that I can take these few problems and still love this laptop!

 Just received this unit and I was excited.  Everything looked perfect up to the point when I pressed the power button.  The unit would not powered up.  I hooked it up to its power brick but still no.  I called Amazon support and he issued me a refund right away.  I was hoping for a replacement unit but he simply told me to order it again because he couldn’t do replacement in his system.  Even though it didn’t power up, I really like the form factor.  The keyboard feels great and the case feel sturdy.  It was a disappointment but I will order it again when it becomes available.  (Just found out it was out of stock.)

Four Stars

Truly a nice product, but overpriced in general. For example, the Asus Rog G14 (G15) usually have the same internals (i.e. rtx 30s with either the AMD or Intel CPU's) yet for lower prices. I could only sum it up to just the branding since razer is really popular with gamer elites. Really dislike not being able to upgrade the ram, which is due to the ram being integrated onto the MB for ""higher speeds"". Also a lack of a second slot for the memory capping you at a 2 terabyte. Now,  you could be adventurous and try upgrading to a 4 terabyte NVME SSD, but those are usually double sided leading to bends. Still a nice product to get done what I need it for. (Music Production)

THE GOOD:- 8 Core Ryzen ""Zen 3"" based CPU.- Solid RTX 3070 100W mobile GPU.- The lightest ""gaming"" laptop I've been able to find (under 4 lbs).- High refresh rate 144p- Silent even when gaming- Does very well at gaming and productivity.- TONS of ports.- Decent battery life.THE BAD:- Memory timings are very poor.- Memory not replaceable.- Barebones BIOS.- No DisplayPort option.- The power brick weighs as much as the laptop (I will try and grab the exact weight and edit this review).THE UGLY:Fingerprint magnet. RAZER PLEASE FIX.THE LOWDOWN:If you can find this laptop for MSRP ($2,199.99) it is worth it. Just be ready to clean it regularly.

Great machine, but with its flaws
","
Pros:- very portable, you can hold it with one hand and open the screen without having to pry it open with two hands- great for gaming- keyboard is practically the softest keyboards I've ever touched on a laptopCons:- battery life is abysmal, I think I get up to 2 hours or a bit more with light usage- I dont like where the power button is, because I use the delete button often too so I sometimes click the power button on accident- the speakers aren't that great. I can't even use them for my zoom calls on a moderate setting. It sounds so bad with speaker buffering noises if the volume is at more than half.- webcam quality is not so great, especially for a device that's supposed to be on the high endOverall, I think the only reason I bought this is because it's a very portable, fitted with a high end gpu into a small device. Other than that, the speakers, webcam, and battery are all on the lower end of the spectrum.There's are lots of cons I've found from owning it for quite some time now. I think that if it weren't for the portability of the device and the gpu, there's no reason to get this, especially for the price range. I don't think this would end up being my daily driver down the road. If there are other laptops that are portable 14"" or have better speakers/webcams, I would admit that I would put them into consideration for switching over (in terms of daily driver).

Razer's Subpar Support
","
I was very excited to receive this laptop. It worked great for some games, however others would crash the entire system. New and heavily graphics intensive games in particular ran fantastic. Games like Elder Scrolls Online and Genshin Impact however would run for 30 minutes before crashing to a blue screen if death. Initially I thought I had found a solution that worked for a few weeks but stopped working. That's fine, I thought, I'll just contact Razer support for a warranty claim. After a week or two weeks of emails, mostly due to them not responding quickly (greater than 24 hours) and when they did it seemed they did not read any previous emails, I got the go ahead to send it in for a free repair. That was two weeks ago. A week in I was informed that no hardware issues were found and that reimaging windows had fixed the problem after a series of tests. Cool, I had done that but if they are testing it and it's working I'm happy. I received daily emails saying they are waiting on shipping information. I do not mind waiting, but considering the repairs were complete and my product was ""working"" I was getting impatient. Two days ago I received an email saying they couldn't find a problem and to explain the issue. The issue explained several times at length and even caught on video in the very same support thread. I expressed my frustration and have not received any more emails. Considering the money I spent on this laptop, that did not work, and the support team that seemingly has no interest in supporting me, I cannot recommend anyone take a gamble on this product. If I ever receive the product and it is working as intended with its large price tag and great promises of performance, I will update this review to reflect more on the product. However, given the interactions with the Razer support team this product will always be a let down to me and thus deserving of a negative review.

Faulty Trackpad. Bad Customer service from amazon

Let me start off by saying this machine is good, but I recieved a unit with a defective touchpad where several of my touch clicks werent registering. Defective units happen, but when I went to Amazon to issue a replacement device, it says it was unable to, and directed me to customer service. Customer service is an absolute mess and after speaking to 5 different people, I just got emails to return the device.Now I have to hope by the time of refund, the item is still in stock. This is a high demand item so I am hoping that it will be in stock so I can repurchase the item, but its ridiculous that they wont just issue a replacement.

The little jet engine that could
","
This thing was a great little powerhouse of a machine. I bought it with the idea of using it for schoolwork and some gaming on the side when I want to hang out in the living room with my partner. This could run Lost Ark at a solid 60+FPS with no issues (though I couldnt figure out how to unlock the frames beyond that and didnt have it long enough to try). I ultimately returned the PC as it was way to loud for my preference. The thing sounded like a jet engine in my living room and wasnt a pleasant experience for anyone. The keys got very hot during gameplay. Standard gaming laptop stuff that I was hoping was fixed by now.

Es un producto que realmente me ha impresionado, sobre todo por el hecho de ser tan compacto, liviano, con una gran calidad de construcción, y que puedas utilizar cómodamente tanto para tu trabajo, como para el ocio. A nivel de videojuegos fenomenal, aunque me salta cierta duda por el sonido de los ventiladores, y a veces algo de calentamiento, pero nada fuera de lo común.  Aun no la he testeado a fondo, sin embargo, la autonomía no me genera a expectativa de las 12 horas como la quieren vender, más allá de eso... creo que me ha enamorado completamente.

Not for Video Editing
","
I really liked this laptop at first but I guess that's because I didn't do any video editing yet at that point. The portability is great and for a regular laptop to do light gaming and regular tasks like research, word, watching youtube, then this is the laptop for that although the price point doesn't match at all. The keyboard takes some getting used to. I'm writing on it right now and struggling a bit. Once I tried some real video editing, 1080p downscaled to 720p and even a quarter resolution playback IT STRUGGLED HARD. It actually struggled so bad I have to return this product. I'm going to see if I can get the Studio edition or the gigabyte aero 15 for video editing but sadly this product cant be trusted to do heavy editing.

Perfect Laptop, when it works (Sent back 3 times for repairs)
","
Have had this device for about 10 months now, and I am about to send it back for warranty repairs for the third time. Once the graphics card went out. Another time, it didn't wake from sleep. The third time, the left audio channel went out for the speakers and any external output. (All over multiple re-installs of the OS and general driver troubleshooting, of course.)Each time, I beg them to send me a new unit, but they keep repairing my old one that continues to break. So for the 10 months I have owned this device, it has been out of hands for about 4 being repaired. Customer service is generally responsive, but they demand useless details (a screen captured video evidence of a speaker not working, for example.)Beyond those issues, the laptop is nearly perfect for me. It has an excellent screen and great performance. It runs cool. The keyboard is excellent. The camera is satisfactory. It has Windows Hello. The laptop is gorgeous, and the build quality is top-notch.For the just fine or needs improvement: the battery is fine. I get about 3.5-4 hours with active usage. The speakers are fine. Minor nitpick and not Razer's fault but I want Thunderbolt (or equivalent) for this AMD machine. A one (plus power cable) set up is my dream for a laptop like this. Obviously, this device is quite expensive, as well.Overall, I can't recommend you buy because of the dreadful repair record and painfully tedious customer service experience, despite this being essentially a perfect device.

GREAT little powerhouse!
","
I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.PROS --Incredible Price to Performance RatioVery well built, with no cheap partsFull-size, comfortable keyboardSmall and lightweightGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatwareInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slotI could keep going... it's $200.CONS --No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)Some irksome viewing angle problemsMaddeningly little built in storageAlmost too little RAMRealtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):Introduction (above)Weight & BuildKeyboard and TrackpadScreenBatteryPerformance (including Gaming)WebcamSpeakers & SoundSoftwareLinuxOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)ConclusionLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.With that being said, let me get into the details.WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.SPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.

It worth the price.  Empty slot for adding a second SSD drive (NVME M.2)
","
I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal.  It is  like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core.  Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy.  I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance).  The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year).  After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch.  The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage.  I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2.  I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen.  That would made it perfect for my needs.  It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.Overall, I would buy it again.[UPDATE 2-3-2021]I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm.  The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively.  I just added a screenshot.I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.EDIT:I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S).  This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me.  Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues.  Really happy with it.  I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.

Great for what it is
","
For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get.This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great.If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable ""S mode"", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google ""disable S mode"" and you'll find the steps easy enough.64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.

If you loved the portability and battery life with your chromebook but missed some features of Windows, this is perfect.  I took mine out of S mode (prompted to do so when downloading 3rd party software).  It runs spreadsheets, word processors, and anti-virus software with no issues.  Video streaming, web surfing, email, Roblox with kids, no problem.  Goes all day without a charge.  Smaller than an 8x11 sheet of paper. Fires up as fast as a chromebook. Keyboard works great.  In love with this machine!

I bought this laptop to replace a HP Stream 11.6"" that wasn't keeping up with my levels of tolerance for casual web browsing, streaming, and word processing as my daily carry laptop.  This is my third ASUS laptop and, overall, I am pretty happy with it.-Laptop is very compact, light, and easily fits into a bag or briefcase at about the size of a paperback composition notebook.-Screen is sharp, bright, and responsive enough for web, documents, and videos; viewing angle is a bit limited, but the 180 degree hinge makes it manageable.-Speed is satisfactory for documents, web, and video.  It's only a dual core CPU so it does floor to 100% often when opening applications or installing updates.-RAM is limited to 4GB.  Windows 10 idles at about 50%-60% memory usage; Linux idles around 30% usage.-The pre-installed Windows 10S is pretty locked down, by design, but can easily be unlocked from the Microsoft Store at the expense of storage and less security.-Storage is pretty tight at 64GB, especially if you decide to unlock Windows 10S and update with patches.  Luckily it has a vacant m.2 nvme slot to add a ssd.-The microSD slot is great for transferring files or offloading backups.  The card almost sits flush once inserted.-Keyboard is not backlit and should not be advertised as so.  Instead, there are white indicator lights on the Power, Fn, keys, and touchpad corner.-The physical build quality and feel is superior to my old HP Stream and other budget laptops I have owned.  The plastics are molded better, sturdier, and well finished.  The palm deck doesn't flex under typing weight like others do.-Charger is about the size of a larger cell phone charger and it's only a 1-piece charger with a long power tail so that makes it a lot easier to manage and store than the 2-piece chargers other laptops come with.For the fellow geeks, I installed a 250GB nvme and migrated the factory installed Win10S off the 64GB emmc onto the nvme ssd.  Linux Mint XFCE installed, encrypted, just fine on the newly vacated 64GB storage.  I did have to temporarily tether my phone to it to allow driver manager to reach out to the stream to install the wi-fi card as it's not included with the base distro.  Currently, no custom Linux driver exists for the number key feature on the touchpad so be aware of that if you want to switch to Linux.  I unlocked Win10H on the 250GB nvme I installed and now Windows has plenty of room to grow.  It's now a dual OS boot laptop that I carry with me all the time in my briefcase.  I'm very happy with this system for the price I paid and for the simple tasks I bought it for.

Excellent machine for price when combined with M.2 SSD

I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for ""M.2 mounting screws"" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for ""disk"" in start menu and hitting ""create and format hard disk partitions"".Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for ""Create installation media for Windows"" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search ""asus L210 drivers"" then hit ""support""). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 ""battery saver"" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.

Awesome lightweight everyday task laptop!
","
For surfing the web, checking emails, streaming music services, this is perfect!  Nice construction, lightweight and compact, and beautiful design.  I especially LOVE the inclusion of the USB-C port, which I will use to connect to a portable external monitor.  For every day tasks around the house, this fits my purposes perfectly.Update 1/15/21 - a few things - the product description mentions ""backlit keyboard"" but I can confirm this model definitely does not have it.  Also, the USB-C port delivers power to another device and also transmits data, but does not output video to an external monitor.  And I cannot get the NumberPad function to work, but maybe it's because I am keeping the device in ""Windows 10 S mode"" and cannot update the driver.  Anyway, for $199, I can't complain much about these omissions/problems.Update 1/18/21 - thanks to one of the other reviewers, I figured out how to get the NumberPad to work properly - you need to very lightly touch each of the numbers and they will appear.  I guess I was pressing down too hard.  So with that problem sorted out, I'm very happy with this laptop so far!!

BEWAREl, it seems as though ASUS has issues with ALL their computers...
","
This is my second ASUS this year.  And it's only March.  My first one I bought earlier in the year and it was expensive compared to what it can do.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it will give me the blue screen of death constantly, and I'm a writer, so it's always messing up what I'm writing.  Then my dog dropped it once off my bed and BAM!  The screen completely shattered.  So it's no longer a laptop, as I have permanantly hooked up to my TV in my living room.  So I got this little netbooky thing for writing and kept the other for gaming (Steam games only, as I don't think it can handle more).  And I've had it a couple days and now this one is also giving me the blue screen of death.  I cannot be without a computer as a writer.  So, now, I'm going to have to wipe this one and return it, and buy another brand, because I CANNOT have it just shutting down on me like that.  Getting the blue screen of death repeatedly usually means your motherboard or hard drive is breaking.  And both of these computers are brand freaking new!  Ughhhhh.  IF it wasn't for this issue, I'd give it five stars.  And I was editing a document when it happened, so I wasn't running anything crazy, nor have I downloaded anything but Firefox.  So it's not on my end why this is happening.  Must be an ASUS thing.

I confess I was hesitant about buying this laptop as a replacement for my old travel laptop of many years.  Yes, I read most of the reviews, watched the few available videos and, took the plunge.After installing most of the same software of my other and more capable computers, I was surprised with The ASUS L210M laptop. It is a really good and capable travel laptop in spite of the critics with very high expectations for a laptop of this price and those who are less fluent and knowledgeable about what is a limited spec'd laptop that was designed for basic computations and budget limited people like myself.Most of the critics within the above reviews addressed how poor the display is and how cumbersome the trackpad works to mention a few less important items. Keep in mind that the ASUS L210M was designed for close-up work and the trackpad works great with a highly capable number pad too. The display for video watching is also adequate considering that most phones and tablets nowadays surpass the L210M capabilities.The Windows 10 setup was flawless, the WiFi functionality worked as it should and the Bluetooth captured all the devices I have with no issues. I also bought a 256Gb small memory card to house all the pictures, videos, and other important files from my old travel laptops. Again, no issues or unpleasant surprises.Before returning the laptop and start looking for another similar one, I suggest downloading the ASUS application titled MyAsus that can be activated with the laptop registration. The application is very capable and adequate to solve most of the issues buyers have mentioned in their reviews and also to learn about the L210M.If you are a Windows 10 capable user, this laptop will meet your needs for travel, classroom, and budget needs.

Great except keyboard doesn't backlight and numberpad is disappointing

EDIT:  Ok, so i rescind what i said about the number pad...i guess i was hitting the keys to hard and not turning it on/off properly...so like i just figured out that you just barely have to touch the pad and to turn on/off you have to leave your fingertip on the on/off button for just half a second longer than you think you would need to...i think i will actually love this number pad eventually (need to get a mouse first- turning it on/off a bit annoying but you can still use the pad as mouse with it on but it gets hard to know what youre doing if youre entering a password for example and cant see what youre typing)Battery is great, overall really perfect for my needs.  Screen could be a little better but makes sense its a trade off for the long battery life.  What I don't like is that i thought the number pad would be amazing but it pretty much just doesn't work at all.  Also, I thought the keyboard would be backlit and it is not!

Great value for an internet browsing, word processing and watching video Windows small laptop...
","
You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing... Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics... It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the enclosure, plugged it into a USB drive on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.

I have always found Celeron processors to be the most reliable workhorses, and since I wanted this computer to function as a reliable little workhorse for the type of work that doesn't require 5 cores and 50gb ram, it was actually a selling point for me. The Celeron is as expected - medium speed, zero hiccups or hangups, mild exclusion from some of your fancier computing ambitions (compatibility).I bought two and installed Linux Mint on both, both run smooth, silent, and cool. No fans, an acceptable trackpad (I hate middle mouse buttons...I haven't found a way to map that thing to register as a standard left click yet..), empty SSD space, and all of the components registered with Linux Mint instantly EXCEPT the realtek wifi card. For that, you'll need to plug into a USB wifi dongle and perform a couple driver updates.So - I now have one in Mexico and one in New York, both of which I use to control CNC machinery. All is well.

I love this laptop.  I got it for Windows but I wanted to see the performance of Ubuntu 20.04.  I am much happier with Ubuntu.  Things that don't work after initial install with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:  WIFI, Asus Touchpad (numberpad).  The Additional Drivers did not add the correct working driver, but both drivers/utilities were easy to find with a little searching so I have everything working so far.  I needed a temp USB network card to download and install the WIFI drivers.  Battery is amazing and suspend works with fresh install of 20.04  I give this a 5 star because I am comparing this with other laptops in that price point.  I am blown away at what a capable little Linux development box, I have been running PHPStorm and Docker.  Feather light laptop with silent running.  I don't game  so I can't really speak to that but for 228, I wouldn't expect too much.

Last December I purchased a 10 inch Android tablet. I'm not a big fan of using my hands to navigate a screen that size. I ended up buying a keyboard and mouse for my tablet. When I traveled I ended up carrying a tablet, keyboard, and mouse to accommodate my needs. It ended up too much to carry. I ended up purchasing this laptop and it is perfect for what I need. I installed a 128gb micro SD and it actually let's you choose the content that you want saved to the laptop or the external storage automatically. It Does everything I need done, booking flights, creating documents, online shopping, and viewing content. The screen is average, it's not the best but it looks fairly decent. Viewing angles aren't the best but you really have to be super picky to notice. Keyboard and touch pad work great. Windows runs extremely well on this laptop. It is very well optimized. I highly recommend this to anyone that has basic computing needs. You won't regret your purchase. I bought this used for 130 dollars. Best money I've spent this year.

This is my forth day using this mini laptop. I have to say that is has totally met my expectations and more! I do my homework on anything I decide to buy, this was no different. I knew that it was going to be smaller than a typical laptop. Yes, I was expecting a 11.6""x 7.6 laptop. I measure before I purchase(; No, it isn't a touchscreen. I bought this awesome gadget because I have a teenage son that I homeschool. I wanted a small laptop that I can use while he is on our main home PC. I love the size! Totally lite and portable! I added a Samsung 256gb. micro SD card for extra memory. I chose not to install the Windows 10 H upgrade. I will be using the Windows S that it came with. I'm not doing heavy duty stuff on this laptop. I'm not gaming or using it like I would a PC. I like to research, Youtube, shop online, take some online courses, ect. My son uses the PC for school, video editing, and gaming in our home school/ craft room, while I can do my own business on this new mini laptop. I am very happy with my purchase! By the way, I did install the free year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal version. It is worth around $70. The installation was a breeze! You must set up a Microsoft account, if you don't already have one, and set up a credit card for automatic renewal for next year. The awesome part is that once you have a Microsoft account, you can use the Microsoft office on any personal computer device as long as you sign in and download the software. Remember that the free version of the software that comes with this laptop is for one person (not the Microsoft Office 365 Family), although I think they offered that for free for 9 months instead of a year(: A great deal as well because you can add up to 5 family members for that account! I hope this review is helpful to you(:

I bought this laptop to replace my previous ASUS laptop which had served me well for eight years. They make a quality product and I trust this manufacturer. I use it for work and I have to travel from room to room in my building. (I'm a substitute teacher) its small size and light weight make it ideal. The battery life is great too, a big improvement. It gets 15 plus hours on a full charge. My other one only got 2 hrs. This is due to the eMMc memory, no moving parts as in a hard drive. Every bit as powerful as a larger laptop. The only downside is that it doesn't have USB 3.0 ports or an Ethernet port, but this is easily remedied by using a multi port hub that connects to its USB C port. (also available on Amazon). It comes loaded with Windows 10 S version, but it's easily converted to Windows 10 Home Version. I believe that this machine was designed with students in mind, but I see many adults using small laptops like this, so they're great for adults on the go too. I bought a second one for my husband too. He loves it.

Works great with the right Linux, with some installation finesse
","
4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is not enough for Windows 10. It will install and run, but slowly and system updates will eventually eat up all your storage. 4GB of RAM is even light for some Linux distributions. But I put Xubuntu, a lightweight Linux distro, on the laptop immediately before ever booting Windows. Out of the box, wifi does not work. It requires the ""rtl8821ce"" driver, which is on Github. Without network, this required downloading the Ubuntu ""DKMS"" package, in addition to the rtl8821ce driver, onto a USB stick and then compiling and installing on the laptop. Because this laptop has secure boot, it will create a key for you and enroll it in the laptop's firmware, which must be confirmed after you reboot the machine. This sounds difficult but it's not bad. Another reboot later, and you have a perfect working light-usage Linux laptop for just a few hundred dollars.Though this laptop is underpowered, I gave it a perfect score because for the cheap price it is a great value.

L210. Great little machine for what it is. Had it for about a week. Switched to Win Home and turned off/deleted a couple dozen stupid Win10 resource eaters. Turned off ""Fast Boot"" (always bad to have yesterdays mistakes reloaded, especially stupid idea for any RAM based drive). Only adds a few extra seconds to the boot. Updated to 20H2 with no issues.Swapped the Wifi for the Intel version (AX200) and doubled my ping rate (don't know why the original was so slow). WiFi will never be screaming fast with just 1 Ant.. Installed a Samsung 980 M.2 SSD (needed to pickup the extra screw (used M2x3 Big Head)) to offload installs/data and keep the ECC usage as small as possible (currently about 1/2 of the 64G is used). SSD is running ~1/2 it's capable speed because of the x2 buss limitation (only +$10 over cheaper ones at the time and I've had good luck with that brand). Formatted 370G of the 500G SSD as a basic NTFS data drive. Saving the remaining 100G to dual boot into 1-2 Linux, etc. OS, which will share the data partition as needed.Now has everything I wanted except the RAM. Would have liked 8G to run more than a couple things at a time. So far, Win10 is running fine with the 4G, but will limit some applications. 4G should be fine for most my Linux usages. Screen is a little small for my old eyes but I did want small and portable for travel usage (should be perfect for that). Build quality seems very good. Love the quiet (no fan) and heat does not appear to be an issue after the initial updates (very CPU intensive). Time will tell if it holds up getting bounced around over time.

A solid low end laptop
","
This is a well built solid low end laptop.  You should not expect much power from this system.  However for web browsing, watching streaming services (like Youtube, Hulu, Amazon), and basic office tasks like word processing, Quickbooks, etc this laptop works without issue.The solid state storage allows for fairly fast boot times despite the low end CPU/processor.  The two main downsides are the RAM and onboard storage.  There is only 4GB of RAM which is okay to start up Windows and a few applications but I would caution against trying to run to many applications at once.  Also I would watch my web browser tab usage and not open 20 tabs at once or something.Plus with the limited 64 GB SSD storage means you are not going to be installing a lot of programs.  This includes modern games.  This laptop is not a gaming a system.  Oh sure Bejeweled or something is fine but no way you are playing a modern FPS.This laptop is an entry level system which is good at basic Internet usage.  Think of this as a Windows power Chromebook.  It is also great for flights as it is small, has good battery life, and light.  This system fits a niche usage.  If you desire a gaming laptop or full desktop replacement laptop keep looking.  However for the use cases mentioned and/or a secondary laptop this could work quite well.

visual studio installs!

while this review is otherwise early, i thought it worth noting that the process of upgrading from windows ""S"" security mode and installing visual studio, and an array of hardware and software development apps has gone smoothly. i was concerned about the processor meeting the minimum requirements since i had little understanding of these new variable ratings - the geekbench rating is about 16 times higher than my old toshiba ;)while i haven't made sufficient observation of processor speed beyond use during setup, i haven't found any frustration with the speed of these operations. tbh i'm pleasantly surprised to have installed some older 32 bit apps such as synthedit and ones i wrote with borland's 90's fclt compiler and see them run without prejudice.the overall size is close to my aged toshiba netbook, except that it's light and quiet and probably tougher with the SSD. the pixels are so small i can hardly discern between them.i'm sort of amazed after earlier perusals to be able to purchase a functional development platform for $210. the only drawback i've found is that the keys and the work surface are all black, and the letters are thin, you can't see the key layout when its dark, i understand people are used to fancy backlit keys, i'd just recommend a colour contrast.lovely thing.

I am pleasantly surprised by the performance and versatility.  I have it dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux.  I opted to take Windows out of S mode.  I also opted to leave Win 10 on the 64GB eMMC drive and install Ubuntu on a Crucial P5 500GB NVME SSD.Pros:Boot time is lightening fast on the NVME drive.  Still very fast on the eMMC drive.Very portable.Plenty of ports/connectivity  (HDMI, 3xUSB, microSD)Keyboard is still usable, if small (although the number pad is a bit gimmicky)great battery lifeCons:screen brightness and color isn't great (didn't expect that at this price point)needs more RAM and it can't be expanded (this is the real drawback of  using this hardware in a PC instead of a Chromebook)not a well supported wireless chipset (RTL8821CE)Needs USB-C power.Regarding the wireless chipset, it is *not* supported in Linux kernel versions < 5.9.  Which means it's not supported out-of-the-box in Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10.  I had to download drivers from github and compile the module to get WiFi working.  Also UEFI secure boot had to be enabled for WiFi to work.

Those looking for the latest and greatest, don't bother. This machine is great for web browsing, document editing and such. I don't play games, but doubt it would do well. However I bought this used for $88 and spent $35 on a 256gb nvme SSD. {that's definitely needed} The storage at windows first boot shows only 17GB free. Get the NVME SSD. Once you've installed that do the free upgrade to windows 11. Use the media creation tool and do clean install. I also flashed Google's Cloudready OS to a USB C flash drive and was able to use it from the flash drive without affecting the system storage. This would make a great Chromebook.  Overall, it suits my needs for web browsing and document creation and YouTube.  I also use it to test out different Linux distros.  At up to $120 used worth it, not more than that though.

Easy to use, up in a second.  I love it.  Then I realized that I couldn't hear a damn thing.  I'm on a computer 12 hours a day, I know how to work them.  I adjusted the controls...blah blah.

How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear.

The only real complaint is that they advertise a backlit keyboard.  I read reviews before purchasing so I was aware of this.  Not a deal buster at all.Keyboard has a great feel.The touch pad number keys work great.It's is very light but feels well made.So far battery life is outstanding.Time to get a spare power cord.  If something happens to the original charger, I would be dead in the water.Also I downloaded as little Microsoft as possible.  Thanks to Google, starting up a new laptop is a breeze.  All I need is a little word processing, email, and web browsing.  Google does it all and quite nicely at that.  I am not fond of Microsoft at all.

Reason I bought this is to be used next to a microscope, so I can write reports while looking through the microscope. Screen quality is okay. Keyboard is kind of small but you can’t expect much from an 11 inch notebook. Storage is just for basic programs (Office and Edge mostly). The only small backdraw is the numpad on the mousepad sensor thingie.. it gets stuck sometimes but you can just get an external numpad or use the ones in the keyboard. Small size storage, but, is just a small lab/biz PC (bought a 128 gb flash drive to store reports)This really gets the job done. Def not something for gaming

It's definitely easier to turn on than to turn off.

Great Budget Laptop
","
Bought this laptop for my daughter, who is in first grade, to use for her zoom (online) classes and school work. It works great. Please realize that this is NOT a premium laptop, so don't expect anything fancy or outlandish performance. It works well for actions that do not require a lot of RAM/speed, like zoom meetings, watching videos, listening to music and basic school work. Having used Intel Celeron based laptops before, I was careful not to install too many software (that will only slow it down). The screen, speed and memory are adequate for my daughter's school needs. Finally, I switched it from Windows 10s to Windows 10 because 10s was too limiting/didn't support some downloads/didn't have any good apps in the Windows ""appstore"". It's free to switch from Windows 10s to 10.

I bought this laptop primarily for web browsing and it's perfect for that. I like the keyboard, and the numpad in the touchpad is a cool feature but a little strange to use. I've watched few videos but the speakers seem decent. The screen is...bland? Dull? So I don't know if I'd bother with trying to watch Netflix or anything, I'll stick to my tablet for that. That said, I like that the screen is a matte finish. It's very portable and the battery life is great. There is little storage space (most is taken up right out of the box) so I also got a ~$25 128gb microSD to expand the storage just in case I decide to use it for documents, photos, etc. It comes in ""S Mode"" but it is FREE to switch out to regular Windows so you can install stuff that's not in the Microsoft Store. I don't know why some reviews say it costs money to switch out of S Mode. Overall, I think this is a great little laptop for when I want to browse the web on something other than my phone.

I bought this because I wanted a small,, light-weight laptop to do word processing on.  It's the perfect size and weight.  The keys are nice and hard (I hate soft keyboards), and I didn't realize this when I ordered it, but the touch pad becomes the number pad by touching the on/off square at the top of the touch pad!  The battery charged quickly.  I have been using the laptop for about 45 minutes now, and it's not so hot that I can't keep it on my lap.  My old laptop had that problem for sure!

First thing is first, this is NOT a gaming computer. Second thing is second, that did not stop me anyway. I tried playing final fantasy xi on it while streaming from my phone. You can get the game to run on LOW settings, and it plays semi smooth. For modern games, do not even bother. Final fantasy xi is darn near 20 years old. Kiddos attempting to play things like fornite at 60 fps will be extremely disappointed. However, this is a speedy little computer for what it is built for. It has a nice design. Lightweight. Bluetooth (that one actually surprised me), built in wifi card, and actually runs pretty speedy for a little laptop. Every other laptop I have gotten this size in the past has been super slow, but this little guy surprisingly holds its own. Great for running basic applications and experimenting with silly stuff (i.e. trying to play mmos in your car while stteaming from a mobile device while utilizing its hotspot capabilities).

This laptop is good both in its size and weight. I would say that that everything is fine except the fact you couldn't add additional ram (4gb soldered to board) you can however add a nvme ssd to it which is a plus if you want to dual boot or have more space, also I could say the TN panel is fine for this price range not a colorful IPS display but it suffices. Just don't expect to be running to many tabs or almost any game on here I would suggest to keep it light so booting it won't be a problem for the celeron cpu inside.

I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the 'no wifi' reviews; I actually thought that 'I wont get one of those', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi,  they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable  person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident.

The screen is bigger than I thought in a good way tho! I am happy with it. I don’t use this for business I just use it to study online classes and general browsing and YouTube. I don’t know if it will satisfy business users if they require more internal storage and more powerful ram, but for me I am satisfied with this laptop and it’s my first ever personal laptop I can only speak for my own experience.

When judging this laptop, always keep the price in mind.First, the cons:Is it a gaming computer? No; the graphics adapter isn't intended for that purpose. Is the housing suitable for those (e.g., children) who toss around electronics without regard for their durability? No; it is cheap plastic. Don't buy it if you expect to use it for those purposes. The matte screen isn't the brightest. The sound quality isn't immersive. There is no optical drive.Now, the pros:The price. This is a 15"" laptop with Windows 11. Even though the laptop isn't for gaming, I have used Adobe cs6 software with no issues— Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Audition. Rendering video isn't super speedy, but it isn't unreasonable. I was extremely doubtful it could run those programs, and didn't buy it for that purpose, as I have another computer for it, but it was definitely a great and welcome surprise.Who should buy this laptop? Anyone who wants a light-weight computer for school, travel, or home, on which they can use email, stream video, take notes, browse the internet, or even edit photos and short videos in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.[As a sidenote, I suspect this laptop would have no issues with the beautiful and ubiquitous memory hog, Google Chrome, but I have not installed it. If you do a lot of browsing— and who doesn't?— then I would suggest looking at other browsers, such as Vivaldi. I offer that advise no matter which computer you might be using, so it is not specific to this laptop.]

I bought this for my wife, who teaches English at a small university in Zimbabwe. She LOVES it!! She doesn't game with it, so doesn't need a super-fast computer. She loves the solid feel and the quick reactions. So far it does everything she needs to do with it.

For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd.  The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use.  Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive.  Glad I bought this.

I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available.

I actually swapped the laptop from Costco for this one. The screen is huge! The processing apeed is okay too. It's just that i'm not used to the positions of the keys on thr keyboard.

I’ve had this laptop for less than 24 hours and there is no Wi-Fi capacity only VPN or Ethernet! In 2022 that is totally unacceptable! Don’t waste your time or your money. I spent over an hour on the phone with HP only to have the representative hang up on me when she wasn’t able to identify the issue. Thankfully Amazon will refund my money but in the meantime I will have to go buy a working PC that actually has Wi-Fi capability.

I bought this to replace my current i3 Dell, which is 6 years old. It has slowed down considerably, and it constantly loses its wifi connection. At first, about a year ago, it would happen once or twice a week, but now it happens every few minutes. NOT my wifi. All other devices work fine.  I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago, and it only made it worse. I need reliable WIFI for my job, to attend Zoom and Teams meetings. Out of the box, I was impressed with this model's speed and connectivity. But, I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home, it would not connect again. It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished. It's only a week old. I'm returning this and going back to Dell.

Performs Well, Fans Not as Loud As Expected
","
Reading the reviews for this PC, I was expecting this laptop to sound like it's about to take off at mach 5, but it's really not that loud compared to a struggling older PC or an original PS4 pro whose fan is overworked on newer games. Sure it's not quiet by any means, but not nearly as distracting as I anticipated. Performs well but does get pretty warm during intensive gaming even with an additional cooling pad underneath, so definitely get one of those. The weirdest thing is that when you plug or unplug your charger, the screen goes black for a couple of seconds, presumably due to switching power settings. Shouldn't be an issue during gaming sessions however as of course you should have it plugged in for performance anyway, but something to be wary of if your charger cable ever starts to go out. Internal memory isn't huge so I did buy an additional 4TB SSD, which installed smoothly. Runs FFXIV without issues and scored an extremely high on the Shadowbringers benchmark and a very high on the Endwalker benchmark, so should be good for MMO gaming for another couple of years without upgrades.

 IT has been my livelihood for more than 30 years. I built many of my own computers. My current custom water-cooled Tower is in storage as I'm in the middle of a move.I needed a semi-decently powered laptop to use while my RIG is stored away. This Asus TUF laptop caught my attention for being decently powered but not breaking the bank. When first received I was pleasantly surprised. Speed, nice sized screen. I updated all the drivers needing so as well as patched the OS.The issue starts as soon as I play any MP4 video using any player be it the built in Media player or using VLC the 1650 Ti GPU takes a crap. Video goes all awry. I've attached a video to show this. I'm not going to be dealing with a BRAND NEW laptop having video issues right out of the box. It's going back.

Good Gaming Laptop for a Budget

No issues so far, great laptop for the price. The larger screen I love; I did do an upgrade to 16GB DDR4 and added 1T secondary m2, still have room for a standard SSD if I want.The upgrade wasn't a required upgrade just something I did to make it a bit more future proof and expand so I could also use it for work.Even with the upgrade the price is below 1100.00 for a very capable Gaming machine.Playing Fallout 4 before the upgrade I was using Ultimate settings and it never slowed down or stuttered.You do sometimes notice the fans spin a bit faster but that's to be expected. It doesn't get hot that I have found, it's heavy but again to be expected; it's built to be tough, to take the bumps and bangs a laptop gets and keep on going.Looks great to, I do notice some fingerprints/palmprints leaving marks but a quick wipe-down removes them.

I had the Asus 750 before that for which I paid around $1250 and after 7 years began to show its age - albeit still very useable. Thinking  needed to spend that amount again or even more, my local computer guy recommended the F17, voicing several very distinct features which this had, over my old one.One of them was that the weight and thickness were 50% of my old one.Once I had bought a 1TB SSD, double the memory, exterior DVD player/burner and a few other small accessories, the final bill - after configuration by my computer guy- was under $1250.I have various design programs on it in 2D and 3D, along with tons of high res photos. The F17 has plenty of oomph to digest everything. It starts up in the blink of an eye.This laptop is worth every Dollar and you'd be very silly indeed to pass this over as a first or replacement.

Got it to play FF14, does the job
","
So I got this to play FF14 while I travel and am away from my actual gaming PC, and this does the job perfectly. It's just generally a really capable laptop -- handles streaming, gaming, did some remote work and calls on it np, etc.I love how lightweight and quiet it is.There was only one initial problem I had with it which would have been a deal breaker if there hadn't been such an easy solution -- while I was waiting in that 4k+ q that's the current reality (as of the EW expac), this pc's fans started going haywire.. SOOO loud, heated up, unacceptable. To fix: simply adjust your maximum power state. Docking it a mere 2% will stop it from making any insane noises and return it to the silent, smooth state it runs in when doing everything else (only had the problem when running games, but again super easy fix.  (if you don't know how to adjust this or what that means this is how you fix: Right click your lil battery icon, hit power options, next to the ""ASUS Recommended"" power plan click ""change plan settings"", ""change advanced power settings"", ""processor power management"", ""maximum power state"" -- reduce this from 100% to 98%. Problem solved, resume quiet, beautiful laptop fun).

What can I say? Reading about the negative reviews about this product had me quite afraid to get a damaged piece on delivery. However the laptop arrived in perfect condition and I am very satisfied with the packaging, delivery time and condition of my package.Secondly, this laptop is very good for most of the games in the market.  Though I don't know if it will work well on high end core games present in the market nowadays. However for the games I like, this works super fast and I am quite satisfied with that.And thirdly and most importantly, I am also using this laptop for my work purposes and for that I have to run multiple software at the same time and this quite demanding of the system.

La compré para uso personal, actualmente la uso para jugar y al mismo tiempo para el trabajo, uso programas de edición de videos, arquitectura, renderizado y algunas cosas, la verdad no me ha defraudado ni en la calidad de mis trabajos como en el rendimiento de mis juegos, la he usado en fortnite, rocket league y en League Of Legends, sé que no son los juegos de mayor demanda gráfica pero al menos a mi me ha servido incluso más de lo esperado por el precio que la compré. Me gusta que sea ligera, en verdad es muy ligera para ser una PC gamer, la puedo llevar sin problemas a donde quiera y siempre me rinde, lo único que he visto, obviamente por la condición de laptop, es que en juegos no te durará mucho si la usas con batería, con esta PC sí o sí tienes que jugar conectada al enchufe si quieres el mejor rendimiento en juegos y también en aplicaciones y programas de trabajo como los que yo uso. En general es una buena PC para trabajar y jugar en ratos libres, para mi opinión totalmente se merece 5 estrellas debido a tan buena calidad a un precio totalmente asequible. En mi caso cuando me llegó le agregué un módulo adicional de memoria RAM de 8GB, no es que las necesite, sólo que por las condiciones de mi trabajo y la investigación yo suelo usar muchas pestañas de Google Chrome abiertas, y como es de esperar eso consume mucha memoria RAM mas todos los programas que tengo abiertos, entonces para mantener la fluidez de mi trabajo decidí aumentar la RAM, pero si la vas a usar sólo para jugar es más que suficiente con lo que viene. Además viene con velocidad de 2933Mhz, lo cual es bueno, por encima de la media. Por todo lo demás, 10/10.

Well, partially it’s my fault. I wanted to skimp out on paying for full price and this is what I got. A laptop that works fine.. if it werent for a non working screen. I got it for 732$ for an almost new product—it should be perfect; but with missing packaging. It’s fine for me, i thought. I couldnt be more wrong.Shipping took forever. 3 days before they ship it out. Arrived after a week and a half.As soon as i pressed the power button, the leds would turn on, as well as the keyboard would have the lights, but no display. Just a black display of nothingness.I was so furious when it did that. I had to call Asus support and they told me to send it back. Which in no way in hell i would do because i aint paying for shipping for a defective product. I called amazon and they said they’ll refund it. Bought myself a brand new acer nitro instead. Now im scared if that laptop would be defective too.

As others have said before there are issues with the Wi-Fi Adapter and the battery. For me those are alright since I'm planning to buy a Wi-Fi adapter anyways and i use it on wall power most of the time. The issue I actually have problem with is the webcam. It randomly connects and disconnects though its disconnected most of the time. It just says ""Camera has been disabled"" / ""Camera failed to connect"" when I try to turn it on for Google meet and stuff. Worst part is, non of the solutions I've seen in the internet fixed it, usually F10 is for camera disable/enable but here in Asus F15/F17 its for locking and unlocking the touchpad. This is very frustrating since I have been trying to fix the issue since I got this laptop for a month and still no avail.

Seriously a powerful pc. Yes this seems to get hot, it does not. The internal temp is fine and steady under heavy load. The shell helps dissipate the heat. So it seems hot, it is not. I've read reviews, and thats the only complaint other than fan noise... which I found is more than normal. I think its quiet compared to similar powerhouses. Pair this with a cooling dock station and it will run all day without getting hot at all. Use AFMAT, it uses a seal to push air through the laptops cooling system. Its all about the fan ""shroud"". Otherwise cooling docks need gobs of loud air.

Good little gaming laptop, bad battery life
","
First, let me say that I have the version with the 1650Ti, not the 3050. Mine also includes the Webcam, full RGB keyboard, and num pad. There is a slim version that does not have this.Now, I bought this laptop to replace my old daily driver that had a 1050. This laptop is miles better than that one in terms of image quality, GPU power, screen refresh, and sound.I've been using this laptop daily since I bought it. I added a 1TB SSD for storage, upgraded the RAM from the included 8GB to 32GB, and dropped the refresh rate to 60Hz to help battery life (which I will get to later).As far as this goes as a gaming laptop, I've been able to run everything I've thrown at it at max settings. Fallout 76 runs at a solid 48fps (its capped there for some strange reason) at max settings. Gears 5 runs at 60fps (again, capped) on max settings even with all the environment and snow particles. With the IPS display, these games look super good. Huge upgrade to my previous laptops TN display. The colors are absolutely crisp and deep.The sound quality is decent. It's not studio music quality, but it's definitely decent enough for gaming without any noticeable clipping issues. I'm able to discern bass, mid, and treble without a lot of muddiness. Obviously, it's not perfect as they are laptop speakers, but given that restriction, I'd say it does very well.Now, the only complaint I have is the battery life. It's nowhere near the advertised. My old laptop with adjusted settings reached 6-7 hours. This one with the same settings reaches only MAYBE 2. If you're playing a game, you'll be lucky to hit an hour. This is not a laptop to play on battery. The higher the graphic quality and the higher you keep the refresh rate (like the native 144hz) the worse it'll be. Even with dropping the refresh to 60 and playing a game that doesn't require the 1650Ti, it still only will last about an hour. Watching videos is longer, but that's still about 2 hours, give or take.Overall a good purchase provided you want it plugged in most of the time.

Unacceptable quality despite all the great features on paper

It's a nice laptop: lightweight, keyboard is just the right heaviness, and display is sharp.I am giving this 1 star because after a week, it's failed catastrophically that requires factory repair which the factory repair tech estimates will take weeks if not longer as the tech believe it is a motherboard failure. In this day and age, laptops should be of much better quality than this. No amount of good features can make up for poor quality.There are many choices at a similar price. I would not recommend because of this terrible experience.

Good specs for the price (a dell xps 13 with similar specs costs 100's of dollars more)decent build quality, aluminum chassis, laptop is pretty sleek and lightweighttouchpad, keyboard and screen are good, nothing special, but not bad eitherbattery life is excellentmy only complaint is that the fans were super loud out of the box. however, after using the fn + f shortcut to set fan profile to silent mode, the machine is very quiet and the fans almost never come onEDIT: I was randomly getting bluescreens (referencing the intel driver). I found that you MUST use the intel graphics driver versions acer's website. If you use any other intel graphics driver (in my case a newer version was pushed by windows update) you will experience frequent bluescreens. Once I rolled the driver back from the windows update version to the stock acer driver, the random bluescreens went away.EDIT: 5/29/21: The intel drivers offered by windows update are now a newer version and no longer seem to be brokenEDIT: 3/13/22: I still have not had any driver or stability issues since the last edit.

I was quite impressed with the specs and price point of this computer. I got the 1tb version hard drive. After about 10 minutes of the first starting up of computer we got a blue screen error. I proceeded to call Acer and they had me do any updates on software that were available. I think the update helped a little but we have had 2 more blue screen errors since. The computer has been in use less than 2 weeks. This should not be happening and as one reviewer stated he had to send computer back after major failure. The cause was supposedly a motherboard issue. Im just afraid that this too may be the problem with ours. Im going to monitor situation and read new reviews to see if this becomes a major issue.

I really want to like this laptop. It's got great features (TB4, Wifi 6, good display) and moderate battery life compared to the competition. However, I just cannot get past the quality control issues. I've had the laptop about 35 days, and so far: - The speakers have become crackly and failed to work at times - The battery has refused to accept a charge, resulting in me having to do a hard battery reset - The device has gotten abnormally hot to the point that I fear for the longevity of the device.Overall, I'd suggest people stay away from this laptop, at least until Acer has done more quality control. It's very frustrating to see a ~$700 laptop fail this badly, and I'd encourage people to take their money elsewhereEDIT: The laptop fully died this week. It was 4 months old.

I am very disappointed to have to write this review. Even more disappointed that I am going to have to return this laptop. On the positive side, this machine is beautiful, light, and the performance is fantastic. On the negative side, the build quality is less than I would expect at this price range (compared to others in the market). On the “this is unacceptable” side, the fan is extremely loud! At minimal load, you can hear the fan, which is surprising. If the machine goes above 20% of RAM or CPU usage, the fan ramps up and sounds like a landscaper is trying to escape from the laptop. It is atrocious! It happens every time I open a video call. 80% of my workload is video calls, making this machine unusable. Man, I am super bummed about this machine.

Great Laptop, Long Battery, Runs Linux Well
","
I bought this with the intention of running Zorin OS and never booting into Windows. So far this laptop has been great. The screen is very nice, the keyboard is decent, touch pad works well, I have never heard the fans, external GPU does work, and the battery is great; which is the main reason I purchased this laptop.In case anyone is interested in also installing Zorin, the camera login isn't working for me even after trying some workaround, webcam works but the hello windows alternative does not. I'll report back after some time, I think its just a driver issue. The finger print driver also does not work. There are some claims that some users were able to get this working but I have not been successful. I'm not really all that interested in those options but it would be nice to get the finger print device to work. For graphics, the Xe driver doesn't seem to work that well but I'm guessing that with some time, this will change.Overall, I'm super impressed and very happy with this purchase. I can't speak for Windows as I never let it boot before wiping out of the box, due to the systems specifications the bloat in Windows likely causes some resource issues. I imagine that this is what causes most of the bad reviews on this system, outside of hardware issues, hot tip, avoid manufacturer warranties, complain to amazon and get a new one shipped...I did end up buying another for a family member (50+) and installed Zorin on theirs as well, after a week they say its their favorite laptop ever so take that as you will.

I'm still in love with this laptop after 11 months

I was looking for a laptop to replace my old acer that I had for 11 years and I was thinking of purchasing another acer. I took about a week before finally deciding on this laptop which was well over my budget but it was completely worth it. I was blown away by the specs and features that this bad boy came with. At the time of purchase this laptop was priced at $999.00. I thought it to be a bit over priced but for the specs and features the price was somewhat justified. This laptop has not dissapointed me a day yet since I had it. I really enjoy using my laptop and I'm always looking to find something to do on it. I've had this latop for just about 11 months and it still takes roughtly 5 seconds from pressing the power button to my desktop showing up. The finger print reader to logon is my favourite feature. i also love the display quality and brightness alot. I don't use the touchscreen much becuase my finger prints are highlighted because of the super bright and high quality display. I haven't had anything to do that really pushes this laptop to prove itself but so far it has worked super great. I would highly recommed this laptop becuase it stands out in all areas and is really an amazing device Acer has built.

Thank goodness I hung in there, and did the updating and upgrading.Steam and some light Steam games like Heave Ho, Ori and the Blind Forest run like a charm. Going to test some other games as the days go on.Definitely worth it if you do a lot of traveling, yet powerful enough to load up a game and pass the time while waiting at the airport or trainstation.

This laptop is fast and runs smooth so far.Overall I would recommend it.Issues to be aware of:  Speakers and Mic are pitiful.  If you want to hear music or videos you are going to want a small Bluetooth speaker.  The built in speakers are some of the worse I have ever heard on a laptop.The same for the Mic.  If you are going to be recording something or doing zoom, Facebook live or other recordings, an external mic is a must.  This mic only picks up if you are right in front and close up.When ordering go ahead and order a thunder dock.  You are limited on what connections you have.  The 3.2 USB works great but there is only one.  The 2.0 USB is as good as they can be but there is only one.  The HDMI works as well as any other, but there is only one.  The USB-C Thunder port is great and the Docking station I bought, Castries Upgraded USB C Hub, 12 in 1 Triple Display Laptop Hub, works well.  It gives you more options and allows you to run more items at once.Overall a very good laptop for what I do.

Puff of smoke six days in EDITED
","
This computer seems nice enough out of the box. Easy to set up, runs Windows, etc. I'm sitting there playing a game six days later, and all the sudden a puff of smoke comes out the back. Now I'm sitting here staring at Acer's chat support app. If an agent ever joins the chat, I'll update this review. As of now, it looks like I paid $1,100 for a brick.UPDATE: It took almost six weeks, but I got the laptop factory-repaired for free, and I have it back. It's a nice laptop for what it costs. By way of illustrating that point, the first thing the Acer support people said to me was ""this'll be easier if you just send it back to Amazon. They'll give you a replacement immediately, and we'll repair the unit on the back end."" Only problem was, a week after I bought it, the laptop was completely backordered.From where I sit, this product seems like the kind of thing where you can get a deal for being willing to put in a little elbow grease. The Acer factory maybe needs better QC, but their Tier-2 tech support handled the problem about as well as could have been expected.If it breaks again I'll update.

Received Faulty Power Adapter, Acer will not warranty
","
Purchased the laptop new from Amazon and received with a faulty power adapter (barrel plug is malformed).  Immediately registered on Acer's website, followed their service request process to file a claim and began setting up the laptop.  Had a full charge on the battery so I spent several hours on setting up the laptop, expecting that getting a replacement power adapter would be no big deal.  Online chat to contact Acer support is completely offline for days at this time.Several days later, I receive an automated email that Acer is unable to complete my request for repair and that my next course of action is to contact the reseller.  Should return the laptop to Amazon, undoing hours of work setting it up and maybe getting a replacement? Shame on Acer for complicating getting a working power adapter.  At this point I'm ordering a replacement A/C adapter and remembering the poor warranty support experience before purchasing more Acer equipment.

NIce lightweight laptop
","
I love the graphics on this computer, which are an upgrade for me after my 10 year old Acer Aspire died. That one had touchscreen, which I miss, but this newer Swift is a great laptop. It is lightweight. I love that as sometimes I travel with my computer and lighter is better! The only thing I haven't liked is that even when the sound is at 100, it isn't very loud. Two thumbs up Acer! You have earned my brand loyalty. I LOVED my  Aspire, so Acer was the only brand I really wanted to look at when I had to replace it.

Great specs but battery life SUCKS!
","
Great little machine. First thing I did was to clean install Windows 11 and it works great.Very fast, nice size, plenty of disk space.The only complaint so far is battery life. It doesn't get half of the 15 hours advertised.Just launch PowerShell in admin mode, then run the powercfg /batteryreport command-let and you'll see that you don't get much. I got 8:26 minutes of very light browsing and word writing.Camera is also nothing to write home about.All in all it's a very good portable machine and if you can get for $999 or lower it would be certainly a great deal.

Good for the Price, Slightly above average laptop overall.
","
Pros: Price, battery life, overall performance, light weight, responsive fingerprint sensor, fast (so for no issues)Cons: PATHETIC PLACEMENT OF POWER BUTTON. I bet you're gonna press it numerous times mistaking for delete button. Same goes for a needless airplane mode button next to brightness button. Wonder how do they not notice while designing.Bad microphone and an average audio quality. Webcam is average too. So not a super we conference/zoom friendly device, but it does the job. Touchpad is below average. I also occasionally get glitches while streaming HD videos, but this is a minor issue. Built quality is average.I do not expect everything top notch for the price it's offered. I would, however, expect a slightly better microphone and touchpad quality. And ofcourse the damn placement of power buttonOverall if you're looking for a decent laptop that can do your regular office/school job with a pretty good batter, go for it. I wouldn't recommend it if you want a premium-type experience. I guess, price speaks for itself.

Super lightweight; bad camera quality

The speed is good and it's super lightweight and thin. Screen color and image quality is good. The only downside is the built-in camera is terrible quality. Unfortunately I'll have to buy a different web cam for my video needs it's that bad. Not crisp, changes color saturation from blue, to green, to red, to normal.Over all it's a great computer if you don't intend on needing the camera for anything.

Stay away from this laptop
","
I love Acer laptops, have owned several since 2004. This one is a huge no-no. The fan is very loud, to the point that you can't really focus on whatever you are doing, and, despite of that, you could feel base overheating after just 1 hour of normal use. Fans are always a problem with Acer, but in this case, it's outrageous. My last Acer buy was a Swift 7 three years ago. I can't believe that this is the opposite of an improvement. The case feels cheap and flimsy, the  startup time is pretty slow, and again, the fan is probably the worse I've ever experience with Acer. The Iris Xe is not the best option either. It appears to slow down the performance instead of enhancing it.

Constant crashing and loud fan
","
I decided to upgrade from the Asus Zenbook I've been using for 6 years, and it was clearly a mistake choosing Acer. During setup, the laptop began overheating just from having two Chrome tabs open. Even with earbuds in you could hear the loud fans spinning underneath. I tried the ""fn+f"" shortcut from the other reviews and it still didn't help.The biggest problem is the constantly blue-screen crashing. This is a brand new laptop. Fresh out of the box. It shouldn't be crashing multiple times when turning on. To fix this (even though I shouldn't have to try to fix a brand new laptop) I installed all the relevant Windows updates in the settings. If you scroll up, you can read a Q&A where Acer America addresses the blue screen error and recommends to install the latest video driver (v.27.20.10.8783 or above) to solve the problem. I installed v.27.20.100.8935. Nothing changes. This is a faulty product that has many other reviews stating the same issues over and over.

Awesome computer

My son wanted a gaming laptop for his birthday. He enjoys Minecraft, Roblox, and some Steam games. I didn’t want to invest in a laptop built specifically for gaming quite yet, but this had specs that I felt would work for his interests. I also followed a reviewer’s advice and instructions (by the way, that review deserves a gold medal) to acquire and install another stick of RAM to bring it up to 16g. Not gonna lie, I narrowly avoided a heart attack while removing the bottom plate of the laptop, but it really was a pretty easy process to give an upgrade that lets my son play the heavier Steam games without lag. He is very happy, and so is my wallet!

Decent, practical, all-around laptop
","
Ok so overall this laptop is a decent, practical, all-around laptop. Not great, but good enough. If you’re a deal hunter and are good at what you do, I guarantee you can find better.If you’re like me, don’t have time to scout the internet, and realized product quality keeps getting poorer and poorer in order to keep from raising prices consistent with inflation, then it’s possible at some point you’re going to settle on something that fits your budget and you’ll accept only being reasonably happy with it (aka I settled).Here is my observation of each aspect of the laptop:* The screen quality is good, but the factory settings have the blacks set too dark and the brightness not bright enough, so I’m going to provide instructions for how to adjust that in just a moment.* The battery life is ok, lasting me about 7 hours currently. We will see how long that keeps up, as I find cheap laptop battery lives are typically trash after about 1-2 years.* The keys feel good to type on, which I was relieved to find.* The speed of the laptop is only alright. For an SSD, I expected it to be faster. This machine will stream video just fine, but don’t plan on doing any video editing or gaming.* The weight is actually very nice, but that should be expected with such a small screen.* One thing I think this machine actually does well is that it does not get very hot, which I like. Previously I was using a laptop cooling pad with a fan, but this computer does not need that. I can set it directly on my bed and it only gets a little warm.* Lastly, and unfortunately, the touchpad needs an upgrade in order to make it usable. At first I thought I could adjust this in the windows touchpad settings. But after doing so, I realized it is not a software issue.The problem is that the touchpad itself is not physically smooth enough. So in effect, what happens is that there is too much friction between your fingers and the pad. That is fine when you’re moving the cursor large distances across the screen, but it means that fine, small movements are difficult to achieve. It was very frustrating to not be able to click directly where I needed to because of this.Luckily, I came up with a solution. You will need to order a touchpad cover / skin for $10. They are basically similar to the screen protectors used on cell phones. It will adhere to the touch pad and provide a much smoother surface. This worked well. The only drawback was that I was not able to find a skin that was made for this laptop, so I had to order a larger one and cut it down to size.Here are the instructions to accomplish both of these tweaks:Fix screen settings:right click on the desktop > show more options > AMD radeon software > display > reduce contrast to 94 > increase the brightness to 25Fix touchpad by searching for this on amazon:CaseBuy MacBook Air 13 Inch Trackpad Protector Cover trackpad skincut it down to size and install it(make sure you read the reviews on this trackpad skin as it is a bit tricky to install and users have posted helpful tips to make sure you don’t have any bubbles in it after you’re done)After you’re done installing it, you’ll need to increase the touchpad sensitivity.Go to:Windows settings > bluetooth & devices > touchpad > taps > touchpad sensitivity > high sensitivityThat’s all I’ve got. Setting up my new iphone gave me a large amount of respect for the seamlessness of the process and the intelligent design that went into it. Windows laptops still have a long way to go before user experience becomes the reason I use them.

Really Good

I bought this for general use, as well as photo editing. I know there are more robust laptops and PC’s out there, but I didn’t want to spend a ton. This laptop is very good for the price. It starts up quickly and handles apps with no problems. I do not play games on it, so I cannot tell you how it runs those. I do have Lightroom and Photoshop on it and it handled those very well out of the box. I did, however, add 8GB of RAM to the laptop and Lightroom and Photoshop do REALLY well now. No issues whatsoever. I didn’t know how I’d feel about the Ryzen processor, but it does a fabulous job.  With the added memory, I don’t think there’s anything this laptop won’t handle.*Note. If you are going to add RAM to this laptop, BEWARE. You have to remove the entire bottom panel including removing the glued on grip pads. When you remove these, they may or may not come off cleanly, meaning they may not go back on the way they were without some glue or repair. Just be extremely careful in removing them.

We needed a computer that was light and portable for school. This ticked all the boxes for what we were looking for, and we bought it and a additional stick of ram. It works well, performance is plenty.But the. Negative, and why it doesn't get. 5 stars. The feet are small starving it for air, even when raising it, the fan loves to spin up, way too loud and waay to often. A laptop cooler rectified this issue but for a low power laptop, not impressed with the cooling. Screens OK, nothing special, which that's this laptop top to bottom, OK, nothing special. I'd definitely but another, but I might pull apart and check the thermal compound, put some higher quality compound on it, and see if it helps.

This may be the best option available for less than $500 as of February 2022. It has decent battery life (7-8 hours), good performance, it’s portable, and upgradable (if you are skilled & careful). Perfect for a student or for business use. You will want to add RAM if you intend to do more than browse, office work, watch movies, etc. Be prepared to deal with Windows 11 (sigh) and some fan noise but that is common with AMD CPU’s and Windows brilliant fan control… Overall, I recommend it. I upgraded the memory and replaced the plastic around the CPU with thermal pads. However, I am familiar with upgrading and repairs. This will be my new productive laptop for work and coding. I’m happy thus far! My only gripe is the screen. The refresh rate is noticeably low with media viewing (Netflix).

Been 1 month & already a burned out pixel. Poor airflow. Don't plan on keeping it long. Warranty it.
","
This doesn't have touch screen on my model. The FHD display really surprised me. It's better picture than a lot of these TVs. As with all products they hide the defects from you until a month later. As soon as the 33th day rolled on I turned on the laptop and discovered sure enough it's got a burnt pixel. No way to fix that without replacing the screen. Unless you have 5+ burned out pixels, good luck getting a return or any repairs. HP is still shady in that regard. I fully upgraded the machine when I got it. 16GB ram, 1TB Samsung 980 SSD. The performance actually is comparable to my tower in many respects. I have a Geforce 980, an octocore AMD CPU, and 24GB DDR3 ram in my tower. This laptop of course has a little less RAM, but it plays games about just as well as on my tower. I really am surprised at this. The cooling situation is absolutely garbage with this laptop. The engineers put the CPU exhaust port pointing directly into the hinge portion of the case. This makes it so the computer is actively fighting by blowing air into a 1/5 CM gap. There is just a row of holes in the bottle for air intake. I picked up a tray with a cooling fan pad and that solved the heat problem. I see it having problems in the future just because of how they designed the fan. The excess heat not only kills your hardware lifespan but it slows your machine down by auto throttling. If I could I would have installed heat spreaders all over the inside of this machine, but there just isn't room. They couldn't even be bothered to make the air inlets in the front of the case. It is asking to burn up after so many years deliberately. I had problems with HP in the past, they screwed up a laptop return I sent in, then blamed me for water damage when I had before and after pictures, so I'm not shocked at how they treat customers. I swore I'd not buy another HP but this one was just too cheap to pass up. It's super light weight. The camera is nothing fancy, in Windows 11, you will find you lack all of your audio enhancement options. It's instead been replaced by this crap HP audio tool. Ditch it as soon as you can and find something like Pulse audio so you can hear out of the cheap cheap cheap dog szzz cheap speakers. You'll also want to get a good set of headphones. The performance is a little low unless you do add that second stick of RAM as so many other people have pointed out. The machine simply wasn't designed properly, and they are taking it out of the consumers pocket by keeping them ignorant and not showing important aspects such as showing how the fan is smack dab in the middle of a 1/2cm gap. When you close the lid and open it after 20 minutes you'll find it's incredibly warm if you have it hooked up to HDMI. It forces you to keep the screen open, which isn't good to have static screens. I honestly think the burned out pixel happened just from the excess heat, but there isn't anything I can do about it. It isn't that bad, but once you see something you can never unsee it. I have a warranty but again, it's not going to cover this damage, so I spent money and not even 30 days later it has depreciated in value by the price of the LCD screen. The case is the cheapest plastic they could find. Given this was produced during the pandemic you're left with another problem. Check your RAM speeds. If you get stuck with a 1R16 chip you're basically having 1 librarian trying to organize 16 shelves, whereas the good ram 2R8 would be equal to 2 librarians keeping up with 8 shelves. Now you can see how the extra work load slows your machine. They don't mention this in their sales page or documentation, and you'll only find out AFTER you get it and run software to look at it, or pull the machine apart. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this machine again, even though it works fast for an entry level computer. It's just too poorly designed. I give it a year or two before it fails. Most likely, knowing HP it will be 26 minutes after the OEM warranty expires. They used this planned obsolescence to rip off customers, and even though it's been nearly 8 years since I swore I wouldn't buy another one, they changed; for the worse.

I’m very happy with this laptop, I’ve had it like 2 weeks now and I’ve used it every single day. It arrived very quickly. It’s fast and it runs smoothly for everything from college programs, homework, web browsing, to even some gaming. I’ve not installed the extra stick of RAM yet as everyone has suggested, but even just with the 8gb I’ve been able to run some lower spec games. Games like Sims 3/4/city, Bethesda games, age of empires, ALMOST everything I’ve tried works and runs way better than my consoles. Whether you’re looking for a cheaper option for playing games (don’t expect crazy graphic or ultra settings), a school laptop, or if you upgrade the ram a decent laptop to run music recording software on, this is a good contender for the price. The only reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars are; the external hardware is nothing fancy, not bad quality just could be better, the battery is great for general use but for games it obviously drains fast, and the material the track pad is made of is not that great. Other than that, I have no complaints and I definitely recommend this laptop.EDIT: I have had it for like 4 months now. I still love it and all of this still remains true. I have played some better games on it as well, such as Ready or Not and Arma 3. Ready or not is playable but definitely starts to reduce in frames the farther you get into the missions. Arma 3 runs like a charm 85% of the time. In single player you van even run on ultra graphics for an FPS trade off. I run the CPU pretty hard sometimes and it does pretty well at keeping up.

I wanted to give this Laptop 5 starts but the battery life is no good. In just 20 mins I lose 10% battery power even when it runs on balanced. Overall a great and powerful little computer. Lightweight and excellent screen quality. Do I recommend buying? Yes.

I like the size and weight and was really surprised how easy it was to set up and transfer from my other computer. My biggest disappointment is no touchscreen. I'd be lying if I said I don't miss my touchscreen because I do but that was my mistake, I thought it was a touchscreen, it is not. It's a little bit slow on the startup but functions well so far in everything I use it for. So far so good.

I got this simply to acquaint myself with Windows 11 as my desktop could not be upgraded.  So far for the budget price it was a good choice, so I'm not surprised the keyboard has a flimsy feel.  It does what I need it to do as a backup device and to get familiar with Windows 11.  My opinion on Win 11 is still out.

FALSE ADVERTISING (read if you’re curious)
","
This product seemed like a bargain...(Ryzen 5 3500U, 8gb model)SUMMARY (2400mhz RAM only runs @800mhz off the charger AT ALL TIMES) (ONLY 1 RAM SLOT)DEEMED: DECEIVINGFirst things first...THE RAMAdvertised at 2400mhz: with descriptions, reviews, and answers that are misleading.  First thing to know: upon contacting ASUS, there are two possible motherboard configurations: one with 4gb of soldered RAM paired with a 4gb SODIMM, and a configuration with NO onboard RAM, and one 8gb SODIMM.  I bought an extra RAM stick hoping to boost up to 12 GB only to find out I had the MB configuration NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT.So you can imagine, as I’m about to add this sweet 8gb stick: there’s already just a single 8gb stick in the slot making the upgrade redundant.Next, I decided to install CPU-Z to see what the hold-up was.  I noticed the laptop was a bit slower than I expected for the specs when it wasn’t on the charger, and let’s be forward here the only reason anyone BUYS a laptop is to use in portable situations hence the expectation of full performance away from the plug.  Anyway, upon installing CPU-Z I noticed a few things off about the RAM.  First off, it ran at a native 1866mhz when plugged in UNTIL you do something that requires an extra push, at which time the RAM ramps up to the advertised 2400mhz.  Secondly, I checked with the cord unplugged to find out the RAM was running at an APPALLING 800mhz.  The ASUS spokesperson said that it was an expected feature and not a defect.What makes things worse: I know how RAM modules work.  A single SODIMM draws such a small amount of power, that revving it down to a speed equivalent to that of a mid-tier DDR2 module is unacceptable!  Just another factory implementation of a throttling method to force people who get their PC for a bargain to regret making the right decision.To make matters EVEN WORSE: this model comes equipped with a Ryzen 5 CPU.  *What’s wrong with that?*  What’s wrong with that is this: Ryzen CPU’s by design, are relatively dependent on the onboard RAM.  MEANING: Slower RAM = Worse CPU performance.So, RAM that performs at 1/3 of the advertised speed, (2400mhz is just OKAY for RAM in the first place) a single RAM slot with no option for dual channel, and a CPU that WILL perform slower as a result make this PC perform at the $150-$200 range when away from the charger.BUY SOMETHING ELSE FROM ANOTHER BRANDThe one plus= The nice screen-to-body ratio.

Macbook Vibes

Honestly, the laptop is great! I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system  feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop.UPDATE:Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life. Sad to see it go.UPDATE #2:Please check comments to this review for more. With all due respect, I won't be updating anything in this review or responding to any of the comments published beyond this date. I hope I was able to help anyone with their purchase.UPDATE #3:4/13/2022I realize Amazon removed the comment feature from reviews and felt that I needed to fill in those people who don't know what was listed in the comments section:The laptop was brand new, the storage drive failed, and ultimately I was refunded the price of the laptop. Asus did reach out to me to help get a replacement, but I was knees-deep in projects and assignments and couldn't afford to wait longer than two days, therefore I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 330s-15ARR that was on sale at the time and was pre-occupied with work from then on.For those still debating whether or not to give this laptop model a try (the Asus one), please don't take my experience as the be-all end-all. Everyone has different experiences and my unit was just one faulty unit out of the many possible working ones that you may purchase. Asus was kind, their customer support was trying to reach out to me but I didn't read their message until I had bought a replacement. At the same time, I want to thank them as well for looking after customer experiences as this was a new product at the time and apologize to that agent for not responding to them as I felt that the situation was already concluded.

Honest Review From Perspective of a Coder/Production User
","
When I was looking for a laptop I wasn't critical of reviews because I didn't think it mattered but when I saw the reviews for this laptop I got worried about my purchase. I'm going to set the record straight from what this product is actually like: good and bad.This is an honest and critical review of the ASUS VivoBook 15 from the perspective of someone who uses this laptop for coding and production (NOTE: I have only used this laptop for a week).________CPU  - Good. Very rarely will I notice quality/performance drops. It does its job.GRAPHICS CARD  - This is where I cannot help you with this specific system. I don't use it for its graphics capabilities. But you should know that if you're looking at this computer for gaming, don't buy it. Buy a system specifically designed for gaming. Even if it costs more.STORAGE  - For me, it's perfectly fine. But you should take five minutes and Google the size of gigabytes and the difference between hard drives and SSDs and all that to decide what you need. But if you don't work with entire databases, the default storage will do just fine.BATTERY LIFE  - Not good. Actually, pretty abysmal. If you run it on the highest of its four default battery life modes you are looking at.. one and a half hours maybe? But if you run it on the battery saver mode, you can easily get five hours. NOTE: The charger is very light and compact, so charging on the go is not hard.SCREEN- Depends. If you have it on full brightness it is beautiful. Looks great. But on low brightness, it kind of looks bad. Not that bad though, so you should be fine.AESTHETIC - A++. Looks amazing, is compact and the built-in stand doesn't take away anything from a normal laptop. I personally was worried that it wouldn't fit on my lap, but it is perfectly fine. The size isn't too big, not too small.________Overall, I absolutely love this thing. It's perfect for students who are on a budget but want something that operates and looks great. I saw something about ""MacBook vibes"" and I agree. If you have one thing to take away from this ACCURATE review, it's that this is the best laptop you can buy for $500.

Fantastic price to performance ratio if you're not into gaming.

I originally bought this computer with the intentions of programming on the go.Let's get the bad out of the way first. This laptop is not designed, nor advertised for gaming by any stretch. You'll be able to get away with some older games but forget about getting reasonable performance at reasonable graphics levels on anything more modern. We're talking just barely getting 60fps on Spyro: Reignited Trilogy at 720p, lowest graphic preset. But that's impressive for not being a gaming laptop. Just keep your expectations in line.The good: This thing is blitzing fast in practically every other regard. This is where the SSD and CPU really take center stage. Everything is incredibly responsive and installs are very painless. Overall usage had me forgetting I wasn't on my desktop at times, so I give this a laptop a solid A+ in that regard. Boot times are damn near instant and restarting to finish installing applications happens in under 10 seconds.Battery life has yet to be tested very well so I can't comment too much on that just yet. I'll update when I get more usage out of the battery but from the get go, it seems pretty standard.Screen quality is again very standard. It's not winning any beauty contests compared to a decent ISP panel but again, it's not advertising itself as being anything spectacular in that regard. You get what you pay for and with this laptop, you're paying for the SSD/CPU performance which it absolutely nails.Style: I absolutely love the way this laptop looks. It's clean, sleek, and professional. Nothing over the top but doesn't look or feel cheap. Build quality is very solid. Obviously it's no MacBook in terms of build quality but it's also less than half the price of a MacBook so again, you get what you pay for.Sidenotes: My first unit had an odd manufacture defect on the screen; A white blotch that was only visible under certain conditions, namely over more muddy colors like off shades of white, dark blues, etc. It was incredibly distracting but I contacted Amazon who stayed on the line with me while we discussed possible solutions with ASUS and ultimately resulted in Amazon sending me a replacement unit in less than two days. The new unit has none of these issues and looks to be exactly what I was looking for in the first place. So good on both ASUS for making a decent laptop and Amazon for honoring the exchange.

Incorrect upgrade information provided.

Good computer for the money. However l sent an email to ASUS asking about maximum upgrade for ram and if there was a spot for an added hard drive. I was told it could be upgraded to 12GB and there is a slot to install an additional 4GB. If l wanted a larger hard drive l would have to replace the one currently installed. As you can see by the photos there is no slot to add RAM but there is a space for an additional hard drive. Even looking up the specs yourself online you are given incorrect information. I had it delivered to the Philippines and am not going to pay to send it back. It is a good computer for the price, my real issue was with ASUS not even being able to provide accurate information to upgrade. Something tells me it can probably be upgraded to 16 but have to replace the currently installed RAM.

This is a sleek and modern laptop!  It barely takes any effort to type. I really like the backlit keyboard as well as the number keypad on the right. There are plenty of ports, HDMI and USB.  The screen appears large for a compact laptop and the resolution is amazing.  I work with a lot of photos and they look absolutely great!  I appreciate the 8 GB of RAM which makes using Photoshop and other programs fast and efficient.  This machine is quick to turn on and seems to last a long time on a battery charge.  It is very lightweight and will be easy to travel with.  I think this is an excellent value!  The only thing I had to get used to is that the power button is in the upper right corner where my delete key was on my old computer, so I've had to relearn the placement of some of the keys.  I highly recommend this computer!

Memory was a mystery
","
The specs said 8GB RAM and also specified 2GB Graphics memory.Actual - 4GB in a slot and 4GB soldered. Total 8GB.However, the 2GB for Graphics was taken from the 8GB RAM, leaving a reported 5.95GB for the system to run on.I replaced the 4GB in the slot with a Crucial 16GB DIMM giving 20 GB total.Minus the 2GB that the GPU takes, that leaves 18GB for the system memory.So available system memory is 3 times what I had to begin with (~3x5.95GB) but it was a bit confusing.

Great device not really a budget computer!

I just received my Asus Thinkbook 15 via UPS yesterday and finished setting it up.  It works just fine and it is much faster than my old Lenovo V570 with an old 2.4 GHz processor.  I bought the one with an AMD Ryzen 7, it is a 4.0 GHz processor and with 8 Gb of DDR 4 ram and a 512 SSD.  Although this device does not have an optical drive or an ethernet port, you can purchase an ethernet port separately and connect it via a USB  port on your device.  Once the device is connected via an ethernet port; your internet connection will be much more secure and a bit faster as well.  I am a computer science major and this works very well.  The notebook itself looks very professional in slate gray and it is also very lightweight as well.  The fingerprint scanner is very easy to set up and once you do, you will be able to log into your account with one touch of a finger.  It is much better and more secure than an old fashion password.  DDR 4 ram is twice as fast as DDR 3 ram, therefore 8 GB of DDR 4 ram is the equivalent of 16 GB of DDR 3 ram.  You can purchase a stick of 16 GB of DDR ram and upgrade the memory to 20 GB of DDR 4 ram for about $50.  As I stated previously, this is really not a budget computer at all.  It is also not a delicate device at all, the hard plastic casing is just as durable as a Lenovo laptop or notebook computer.  Too much ram in a computer can cause it to crash, so can a defective stick of memory.

For those wondering if this great little laptop will take 16GB of DDR4 RAM, the answer is it sure will!I just successfully updated mine I bought back in late February with this DD4 module I just received earlier -Corsair Vengeance SODIMM 16GB (1x16GB) DDR4 2400Mhz C16https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077S17RPZ/I dual boot mine with Windows 10 and Linux (Pop!_OS 20.04) and in both I have 13.8GB total since 2GB are dedicated to the GPU.BTW there's only 1 RAM memory slot on this board and the one that came with this laptop is 8GB which means all 8GB are on this module NOT soldered on the board like it says in the Asus documentation.Just thought I'd make this helpful info public since I was looking for someone to confirm this before making my purchase but just went for it so you're welcome. :)

Great quality laptop for the money
","
I bought the Ryzen 5/ 256GB SSD variant. At $479 in Nov of 2020, with a 15'6 screen, backlit keyboard with numeric keypad and this specs, this is a fantastic laptop for the money. The quality of the screen is great and the keyboard pretty comfortable. The sound is also remarkably good, in case you need to watch something through the built-in speakers.I installed Linux straight away, so I can't review its performance under Windows, but on Linux it works definitely great. This configuration means 8 cores, and everything got recognized and was working flawlessly from the start (at least on Arch Linux, you may get different results with more conservative distros). I haven't come around configuring and testing the fingerprint sensor yet though.My usage is mostly browsing, office tasks, watching movies and programming.I am not a gamer, but do play Minecraft with my son from time to time. It does work pretty well, once you reduced the max framerate from the default 160 or so to a more reasonable 30FPS. The video card setup is definitely not good if you plan to play other more graphics intensive video games, but for the ocassional game, this would also do.As other user reported, the looks are also great, surprisingly good at this price range. It does have some Macbook vibes, which is always nice, and definitely not expected at this price.My only negative remarks are that despite the extended keyboard, the insert key requires pressing the Function key, so there is an extra complication if you use the Ctrl+Ins, Shift+Ins for copy and paste. Also, as reported in other comments, out of the 8GB of RAM, 2 are dedicated to the video card, so you actually have 6GB for the system. Wait till you receive it, and open it to check if you have the one with a SODIMM module of 4GB. I did so and ordered an 8GB module for not much, to upgrade it to the max possible total of 12GB of RAM (10GB for the system).All in all, another perfectly rounded laptop by Asus. At this price and specs there is really no other competitor. Very satisfied with my purchase.I don't have time to write many reviews, but this laptop definitely deserved a good one.

Save Yourself; Don't Buy

Nearly a week after I purchased the ASUS VivoBook 15, I posted a negative review.  My gripes: terrible screen resolution, slow processing, poor sound, the sensitivity of the keyboard, and other issues.  ASUS replied t the effect that they were ""gutted"" by negative reviews, and I took my post down (I hardly ever leave negative reviews, but I guess I should for the Amazon community).  I learned how to deal with this clunky, poorlt manufactured machine.  Today, on nearly the one-month anniversary of my purchase of this device, the screen turns off automatically when not connected to power, and I understand from online searches that this is a recurring problem with ASUS, for which ASUS apparently cannot provide customers assistance with.  Time to get negative (again).  Please save yourself the misery (and money) of purchasing this truly inferior product.  I purchased it to replace an Apple MacBook, because I wanted Windows.  I wish I never had.  I'd like to turn this junk back in to see if I can get warranty on it, but I might be more satisfied throwing the device off a cliff.

There are better options

I just received this laptop so I'm just giving my initial thoughts. So the weirdest thing about the Vivobook is that the speakers are on the bottom, so the sound is muffled. The keyboard has a ""soft touch"" in comparison to my HP laptop. Personally I like the sounds of a clacking keyboard. The graphics aren't as crisp as my HP but it's not horrible. The number pad is rather slim, so the home and end prompts have been added to the 7 and 1 key (hopefully I explained that correctly lol). The battery life is alright so far. I've only been using the laptop for roughly an hour and 15 minutes and the battery is at 55%. Essentially this wouldn't be a laptop to travel around with without a charger.  The laptop feels sturdy, not enough to drop on the floor and it is okay but not bendy. Laptop is quiet but how long that'll last when teleworking is to be seen. There isnt a lot of heat either in comparison to my HP. So I'll update as time goes along***UPDATE 7/10***So the laptop is not charging past 79%... Weird. Very possible I'm the only one experiencing this but better let y'all know just in case it comes up again****FOLLOW UP****Sooooo there's a mode on the laptop that can restrict charging to either 80% or 60% 😂. That's weird but I guess it helps the battery. The option can be changed under MyAsus****April 26, 2021****Failed Wifi card and glitching when multiple applications open, so this is not heavy duty work friendly laptop. Fan is constantly running. Fine for light work and light gaming. The monitor isn't strong. Working on a tractor trailer there are bumps on the road and the monitor just flaps around.

I’ve only had/used this laptop for a day so far. I do a decent amount of video editing and 3D modeling so if your into that, this review is for you.The battery life on this computer is decent. When you’re using it heavily, for example, video editing and modeling (I use cinema 4d and premiere pro), the battery life is not great. You will get roughly 2-4 hours with this computer without it being plugged in.Color accuracy isn’t great, but it’s not bad.The computer is extremely fast for its price. The fingerprint sensor is a very nice feature. I’m yet to do heavy video editing in premiere but when it opens up, it is quick.I used to use a Toshiba Satellite for 3D modeling. Each frame would take around 1 minute with a lot of detail. Using the exact same scene on this computer, it is now down to 20 seconds a frame. (It seems like a while but it really isn’t)Overall I am loving this laptop. As I said it has only been my first day, but so far so good.I will add onto this more as I continue to use this laptop.Update: Over the past month I’ve used this laptop a bunch. For video editing, it’s pretty good. Premiere Pro 2019 runs very easily on this laptop and can do some pretty hefty editing. After effects 2020 also works great but when you want to play back your video, it doesn’t work. Cinema 4D continues to work great with alright rendering times. If you want to game, I don’t recommend this laptop. Other than Minecraft Windows Edition, not many games will run well.

A Very Nice Laptop -- Great Value for the Price
","
I have had this ASUS VivoBook 15 laptop (AMD Quad Core R7-3700U CPU) for about two weeks now, and I am really impressed with it.  I primarily use it for programming C++ and Python, as well  general internet surfing.  The machine has proven to be very quick and responsive.  The SSD drive allows quick startups and shutdowns.  The screen is very nice, with a vivid and sharp display.  I have not experienced any fan noise at all, but have not played any demanding games.  I was a little apprehensive about the 'chiclet' keyboard, but I have found it to be very pleasant and accurate to type on.  My only concern is what seems to be a fairly rapid discharge of the battery.  However since this is my first laptop in quite a few years I really cannot compare this unit's battery discharge rate with any other machines.All in all, I am highly pleased with my new Asus.  The machine is quick and responsive, feels to be substantially built, has a nice display and is lightweight and thin. I will likely add another 4 gigabytes of memory at some point if I use the ASUS for any gaming.  I feel that the ASUS VivoBook 15 is a very good value for the price.

Excellent choice for online learning
","
Much research went into the purchase of this laptop.  Our son, along with many students throughout the country, has had to start distance learning due to COVID-19. I am pretty up on available computer hardware and components as I have built desktops in the past.  There were certain qualities that I felt were necessary in this purchase and they were as follows:- Laptop, not desktop or mobility reasons- 8GB or more DDR4 RAM- 3.0ghz+ Threaded Quad core CPU or 6-core (non threaded)- Integrated on chip graphics- 240GB+ SSD (NVMe prefered)- ~$500 (technology allowance for district)- Windows 10- Dual band wifi card- Backlit keyboard- Numberpad-15.4"" IPS screenWhy did I choose this, I have gone team red with AMD and the introduction of their Ryzen chips, if it's not Ryzen or Threadripper, I'm not interested in anything red, but when you're talking APU (CPU & GPU) combined, AMD has this market 100%. The last computer I built had a second generation Ryzen APU as a budget build, and that has very similar specs to this laptop.  Combined with 8GB RAM and an SSD I was confident that this would be a laptop that was able to provide my son with a great learning experience for more than a year or two.  It has handled everything that we've thrown at it so far.  It's certainly not set up for gaming, but because of its specs, it could probably handle some low level gaming, but if that's what you're looking for in this price range, I would suggest learning to build a desktop, because there aren't gaming laptops in this price range.  To address preinstalled bloatware, it wasn't terrible, I would normally do a clean Windows install, but didn't bother.  Comes with a 30 day trial of McAfee virus protection, I would suggest renewing it, it's great and for a low price you can protect all your families devices for something like $40 for a year.  So currently, we have 3 cell phones, 2 tablets and 3 computers all protected by their antivirus software for the same low price.

Definitely Worth buying
","
This is definitely worth buying. considering the price range for this Laptop, this Laptop is actually powerful enough to compete with a much higher laptop price range. but of course with that being said, its not much for gaming but it can handle games a low to mid settings (depends on the game).the Boot up time is fast. System response is fast as well. although I would highly recommend you minimize any background Apps you have since the RAM is not a lot. 6GB usable , 2GB for Graphics. however, since its Dual channel, its making up for its shortcomings. I just wish that 1 of the RAM was not soldered and should have been replaceable or upgradable.PLEASE NOTE: if you are planning to upgrade one of the RAM, you can do it but at the cost of losing the 2x4GB dual channel.also, the Storage is upgradable, you can just buy new NVMe SSD or you could buy a microSDXC card.all in all I did a bunch of research and watch a bunch of reviews before I bought this laptop, this is just my opinion and I work as a Lab Software Admin which also handles a lot of hardware and stuff.May you have a good one!

The dilemma was.... Wife in Nursing school. Thank god it's that and not a computer class. When I told her she needed a laptop, she said well it's only for light school work so just go grab one of those. ""Cheap"" ones. I as a good husband should. Listened. Well not one semester in and i spent a few days reading about laptops until my eyes bled. I landed on this one for a good college laptop at a good price. I shouldnt have to say that I was worried to say the least. The user is a user who does not know what memory or disk space is. Let alone how to keep the laptop running strong. With that said I took the leap. It paid off. What a great laptop. Powerful. Fast, sleek. Great battery. I would recommend.

A good buy for work

I purchased this laptop for work use. I am a RA so I enter data regularly and usually have multiple sites and programs up running at the same time. This laptop seems to be doing the job so far. I’m hppy with my purchase and one of the reasons I choose this laptop was for its quick response time and its living up to my expectations!Downside: I tried running a browser game that I use to play ages ago to test its ability to run games. For it to run smoothly I had to put the game settings between low and mid even when I adjust the Radeon settings to game mode. I was a little disappointed because I hoped I’d be able to play one or two games on this (like skyrim) but can’t say it’s given me hope since it didn’t live up to expectations for the other game. However, I didn’t purchase the laptop as a gaming pc so it’s not like I was misguided.Overall I’m pretty happy with my purchaseWill update later on as a follow-up

Great Value | Solid Build | Very Happy So Far!

This is my first ASUS laptop, and I appreciate that ASUS didn't stuff the hard drive with tons of bloatware. There were a couple of utility apps and McAfee, but that was it! I have had HP's, Dell's, and Lenovo's bogged down with so much crap from the factory, it is pretty slow from the get-go. With that said, I always take the time to reinstall a clean OS and selectively install just the drivers and utility apps I want. Bootup time is less than 10 seconds and my software runs quickly. Screen quality seems very good. I haven't bothered to color calibrate it yet but the colors are vivid, leaning on the cool side, to my eye. I like the keyboard layout as well. So far, I am very happy with it and I am confident about it to start recommending it to my friends and family. If the laptop runs smoothly for a year, I will definitely buy another ASUS laptop in the future.

I will try to touch on things no one else has.. It seems like the mfg is reading these reviews and is correcting what people are complaing aboiut, so unless they changed the description, it's no longer accurate.Such as some people complained about how hard it was to changee from WIN 10 in S mode, so they made it easier, some commernted that it shouldn't be neccesary at all. So when they shipped mine, it came with WIN 10 HOME preinstalled! It doesn't have light-up keys, tthey are opaque, but the underneath of the keyboard lights up! The keys havre about 2mm of distance between keys making it easier to type. it has a keypad to the right but it is set up somewhat dffferently and takes some getting used to. The computer has a clamshell-like opener, ie. no latch. A one handed person could open it. A key on the keyboard turns it on. You just barely have to hit it and it's on. There is no way to tell if the numlok for the keypad is on or not, nothing lights up. The thing that really surprised me was the thinnes of the power cord. It does not say durability to me, though I don't know that. Don't skimp on  memory. I have 8GB.

Great for daily use- especially school

I bought this laptop because I was finding myself on campus more rather than back at my apartment, and I wanted to work on schoolwork on a computer that wasn't a terrible library computer. This laptop has been incredibly reliable. The battery isn't terrible, but isn't too impressive. It got me through last semesters class schedule where it would be in constant use between 8AM and 3PM, not requiring the charger until about 5 depending on the workload.For general web browsing, word, and video watching this laptop does a great job. For gaming, not quite as much (which isn't really the intended purpose of this laptop anyway). Less intensive games run just fine, I finished a playthrough of The Elder Scrolls Oblivion purely on this laptop.The port situation is acceptable, the inclusion of an HDMI port is a nice touch, as well as an SSD port. Plugging in a dongle for a wireless mouse leaves you with two open USB ports which is perfectly acceptable for a mobile setup. The keyboard is comfortable, and the back light does its job well, though i have it turned off to save battery throughout the day. The screen is pretty nice, with a wide range of luminosity.I've been incredibly happy with this purchase, and if i could go back and do it again i absolutely would. For the price, this laptop is great.

Perfect Lightweight Laptop for Home, Work or School

I purchased this ASUS laptop as a replacement for my dinosaur Toshiba (old-school hard drive, and slow as mud), and could not be happier. I have been using an older solid-state hard drive ASUS laptop at work for several years now, and have been impressed with the performance and speed; so, that prompted me to purchase an ASUS for home and school use. I also wanted something reasonably priced that had the power, speed, and features to handle what I needed for documents, spreadsheets, .pdfs, email, web navigation, etc. This laptop with Windows 10 started up with lightning fast speed, was easy to set up, easy to download software, browsers, and applications, and easy to customize the start window, task bar, desktop, links, etc. I have been using Windows 7 at home and work, and the transition to Windows 10 was nearly seamless (user friendly interface). The navigation to folders in Windows is fast, file transfer from my old laptop was very quick, and opening web pages, creating, opening and editing files (I installed Office on this laptop) is also speedy. The display is a good size (small border), well lit, and very crisp and clear. The back lit keyboard (which can be turned off) is also a nice feature. The sound quality and graphics quality also appear to be quite good. I have not yet used it for videos, but I imagine that will be good too. I do notice that the laptop does heat up on the bottom after some time of use (as some other reviewers noted), but this really is not a drawback for me as I do not sit my laptop on my lap anyway. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.

Purchased when tablet started freaking out. Thought about upgrading (building) desktop with new MOBO etc. Compared pricing and decided better off just getting a laptop. After shopping all the brands and comparing configs I landed on this ASUS Vivobook. It covers all my needs and then some. At a much better price. After adding 16GB RAM (20GB total) and 1TB internal HDD (made easy by ASUS and an add-on drive tray kit), I have the laptop I would want if I could build one myself. And still less expensive than other brands with similar configs. The FHD display and 4K HDMI connection give me display options. Looks great when connected to 65"" 4K TV. Keeping cool is no problem with its venting. Although a little distracting when fans ramp up. The MyASUS app is great for fine tuning operation, connection and sharing (files, video and camera) with mobile devices, and battery life beyond what Windows can configure.Tbh, I've been a fan of ASUS since all they did was MOBOs. I've never been a fan of the OTHER processor guys so I've always matched ASUS, AMD and ATI in all my builds and have never had an issue. Now that is all part of the same family, it's harmonious.

Nothing can make you feel like a relic from the past faster than trying to learn to use these sleek new laptops after having been a ""desktop model only"" nerd for too many years.  My fingers are too clunky, the keys are definitely not where I expected to find them, and the backspace key is my new best friend.  Actually, I never thought I'd cross over to a laptop at all because they were too compressed and I am way to old to want to tackle muscle memory lessons on where to find the keys.I had it in my head that I could breeze through it.  After all it was just a laptop computer and I was computer savvy.  My brother was an IT guy for many years of his life, so I figured most of my issues could be resolved with a simple ""call Bob"".  R-I-G-H-T!!!  Not only had I not upgraded my old computer for many years, I hadn't upgraded the operating system and ... OMG this laptop came with Windows 10.  After about my 5th call to my brother in less than an hour, he very carefully suggested that I might want to purchase a manual on how to use Windows 10.  I think think he also said ""for dummies"", but it was kind of under his breath and garbled.  So, I bought the one for dummies, and another one for senior dummies.  Good thing he lives too far away for me to drive down to see him ... LOLI love this laptop.  As far I know it works great ... my fingers not so much but they're slowly learning how to touch type again.  This one has a nice large screen and the keyboard is very comfortable.  I've always used a mouse, so the finger pad is more annoying than hard to use.  I know I could attach a mouse, but I'm determined to learn how to use it as it is.My old computer system was clunky and took up the better part of a desk surface.  That required me to sit in the back bedroom when I used it and I always felt shut away from everything.  This laptop fits great into a roll-top desk I have in my living room and I'm learning.As you have guessed, this is less of a review of the laptop computer and more about the shortcomings of its clunky old user.  To be absolutely honest, the laptop is great ... it's the user that needs and upgrade.

This is another of a long line of quality laptops that Asus offers at a reduced price that will satisfy your pocketbook as well as perform like a champ. This is a non touchscreen model equipped with 8GB of Ram, 256GB SSD drive and the rising star of CPU's the AMD Ryzen 5 quad core. The first laptop I purchased with a Ryzen Cpu did not perform well but I researched the new generation of AMD Cpu's and they all tested favorably compared to the new i5 8th/9th gen Intel Cpus so I wanted to give it another try. Needless to say this laptop did not disappoint. It can handle multiple tasks, you can have mulitple browsers open, email running, your office suite, plus your anti-virus(all resource demanding items) and it functions like a high end i7 quad core cpu. But the most attractive feature was the price! I have to give it 5 stars because for an economical model it basically can out perform higher end models.

This is my second laptop from ASUS my first one I have is still working from about four years ago but that ones a ASUS ROG gaming laptop. I have finally found a laptop brand that I like and that’s durable which is why I bought this one. I’ve only had this one for a little over two months and use it for my mobile notary business as I needed something light powerful (for my notary needs) and affordable under $600. So far so good so like that way it looks and operates again I just needed something that I could use to operated my business as I do a lot of online business and need to keep track besides using my phone. The laptop is very light weight and the screen is good I put an anti-glair screen protector on mine and the display is still good even through it. It’s super quiet and the battery I’m impressed with it last between 4-6 hours on average if you’re doing some light work. If you’re looking for an affordable yet still powerful laptop look no further. I don’t have any complaints as of yet but will update if they come up.*I must mention that I’m being given an extended warranty from ASUS for my honest unbiased review of their product.*

I was in the hunt for compact laptop w/ decent light video editing. After spending long hours watching/reading reviews, I came to a decision on this model. I was looking for a portable PC that can edit videos on the go while i'm not at my desktop. At first, i was hesitant about the AMD processor due to being an INTEL guy all my life. Long story short, this device has impressed me. The Ryzen 5 processor w/ 8 gb ram did the job and with the help of the Vega 8, this laptop prevented any frame skips, etc. while editing. The screen isn't the best for photo editing but it did the job IMO. Boot ups and your everyday tasks are fast and will not disappoint you. I wouldn't recommend this for gaming but in can handle light gaming @ lower res. While editing videos, i did notice a bit of fan noise but no throttling. I think this is definitely a great buy under $500.One thing to keep in mind that the 8gb ram is a dual channel w/ 4gb on board and another 4 gb that's upgradable. I wouldn't recommend upgrading 1 stick as the processor relies on ram sharing and you wouldn't want an uneven amount of RAM.

Unboxed today.  So far, am happy with this and I continue to learn more about this laptop with each hour.Pros (so far):cheap price for the specsgood looking laptop, with nice wide screendecent keyboard feelresponsive and peppyCons (so far):Screen is definitely on the blah / dull side.  Anti-Glare finish is a plus but at the expense of brightness apparently.Hint:  to get around this you can run the Radeon Lite display settings app and bypass the windows brightness.  This allowed me to boost the brignest and other settings to the point where it's basically not an issue anymore, although still not exactly as I like my screen to look.  But I'm nit picky.Tough for a plastic laptop but I wouldn't want to drop thisFor $479, I'm not going to complain too too much.  THis is a very good laptop in general.

Only 4GB of Removable Ram
","
The 8GB of ram in the description is a little bit misleading. It actually only comes with 4gb of removable DDR4 and the other 4gb is non-removable.  This only has one slot so I upgraded to 1x16 DDR4 3200.  As you can imagine this makes a huge difference in performance as I now have 20GB including the non-removable 4gb.The bottom is fairly easy to remove, just be very careful to keep track of the screws. There are several different sizes, so you don’t want to be putting a long screw where a short one goes. You’ll also need a spudger tool and work your way around the casing.

It is not a gaming laptop, that is very crucial to understand. However, you can game if you are not super picky. I play Overwatch and its doable, but low 30's to 40 average fps (better SSD might help, maybe), after I upgraded the Ram to 20 (16gb stick)- if you really need to game, I suggest using stadia, then you wont really have many complaints with gaming, thats the best experience you will get out of this..  Colors will not be vibrant with this screen but does well with glare. It has a great CPU for work loads, coding, programming, most browsing. Keyboard is very decent cant complain, love that it is backlit.  It has the Num Pad, can't go wrong with that. I plan to upgrade the SSD, I feel saving up for a really good SSD with maybe 1Tb that has great speeds, along with upgraded ram can really boost the performance (from what it comes with). The bios is basically locked so don't plan to make any changes there. I do now duel boot with linux and linux is always better. but depending on the distro, you will lose some I/O functionality. might have to do some digging for the drivers. Can't go wrong getting a decent Fan-stand for this, depending your task it can help with the temps.

This little laptop has really proven itself to me. I use it for everything from note-taking to work related projects, constantly having to shut down and boot up multiple times a day. The boot times actually surprised me how fast they were. They are extremely fast, which is why I rate this laptop so highly. The battery tends to last for about 4-8 hours depending on how much strain I put on it. I don't use it for gaming, so if you're wondering about that I have no opinions on it. It is light and because it uses a SSD it is extremely portable. If you are a student that needs a good, strong tool to help you with your classes or an employee that needs some computing power to work with multiple clients throughout the day, I would recommend this laptop for you.

I've had this laptop for a month, using it daily.  It's a convenient size, spacious keyboard layout, etc. Everything works as advertised.  However the screen and colors are washed out. I had a technician in thinking I just didn't know how to set it up properly. But nothing helped with the hazy blue cast on ALL screens and images.  You will not enjoy YouTube and movies with this washed out color.  Since I use it primarily for word processing I'll live with it. But if I was still in the return window I would have returned it. But thinking it just needed some adjustment I waited too long for a technician to look and tell me that this was all this computer could do.

Disappointed - seller made it right
","
Worked for about twenty minutes after initial startup. Began to download pictures to the D drive (entire reason for the computer) and the operating system began wanting to reboot. After a Windows update, the loop began all over again. Reboot, problem, reboot, problem. Called Dell, and was unable to do anything since the computer had been previously registered. Couldn’t even start it in safe mode. Then, blue screen and total brick. Never seen a computer eat itself before.Seller is making it right for sure, just a total disappointment.

 This product has issues with battery charger. Which Dell has noted. Dell suggested, Replacement battery after one month of purchase date. Or asks you to reset. While screen is blacked out. Orange to white light flashing.Or ask you to remove battery.  Which new is a no way. Especially being new and will void your warranty.  I would not recommend this laptop. 2 one returned for replacement only to have same issue second time. First one screen from free separated and hinge disengaged.

Runs Sims 4 beautifully!
","
I’m in love with this laptop. I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it, i’ll say it. This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY.  It doesn’t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds, and that’s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too, it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly, loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don’t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops, but if you’re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you’re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics, you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet, and it doesn’t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up, but i don’t plan on using it portably so I can’t speak to that. This was worth every penny, and I’m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price. I don’t see how it gets any better than this for little ol’ me

Laptop won’t turn on? READ THIS!
","
This laptop is a bit different from others that I have owned in the past. The charging cable is a bit un-intuitive in the sense that you have to really jam that thing in there in order for it to actually work. In the past, all I had to do was gently plug it in.When I got mine in the mail, I thought it was DOA because it wouldn’t turn on after I plugged it in. You’re actually supposed to press the cable in until you hear a clicking noise. Only then will it work. If you’re like me, don’t panic and give it a try!

DOESNT CHARGE UPON OPENING

When I opened the laptop and plugged it in there was absolutely no activity, charging light did not turn on and laptop had no precharge. After a panicky hour of trying to figure out what's wrong with my brand new very expensive laptop, and realizing how many one star reviews were here for this exact issue, I cannot stress this enough, SHOVE THE CHARGER IN. It is VERY SNUG and you really REALLY have to push it hard. There is a very significant click of the charger going in, and as soon as it did everything was fine. Haven't used it yet, but wanted to update, as I now understand what all the one star reviews about this laptop being DOA are really about. Happy gaming!

Great value gaming laptop, with some standard laptop tweaks
","
This is my newest laptop since 2017, but the laptop I had was from 2016. Far faster than my old one (of course) and runs every program to its max. For gaming a 3050 ti is limited to mostly 1080p gaming unless you play some of the lighter games where you can eek out 144op, but you can easily get 120fps on most games with some tweaks with around 70 to 90 fps on larger AAA titles. One of the first things you have to do with any Acer laptop is go into control panel and change the power settings, they come standard with USB and HDD/SSD auto power off which pretty much puts your laptop to sleep whether you change sleep settings or not. Also, press the (N) button by the num pad, click on the gear icon, and click to make the keyboard backlight stay on. I read some reviews online that said the keyboard backlight would turn off automatically, luckily my last laptop was a Acer predator and they have the same settings basically. Fans are almost non existent when just browsing and you can control them (finally) when doing some intense gaming (or using programs like CAD or the like). Also, the power cord is a dual step process, the first click means nothing, you have to push in till you hear a second click. I was looking for a 17"" inch laptop with more than 2 USB A ports, those ports NOT on the right side (mouse interference), could game at atleast 1080p/above 60 fps, a better processor, and had a ethernet port. Sounds like alot but most laptops are 15"" inch with 2 USB A ports and no ethernet ports now. I'm satisfied with this purchase.*Particular Notes: This comes with Norton installed, Firefox, a planet 9 link, and Windows 11. There's a small learning curve with Windows 11 and I hate Norton, but it's easy to uninstall and Windows 11 is whatever. There is no bloatware on this model, I know there is a model that has Alexa but this one doesn't have it. The SSD is pretty fast but not the fastest, it's better than good enough.*

Best bang for your Buck

Good laptop, this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it’s @2933 and you should be okay. I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it’s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it’s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well. I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn’t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4. I can’t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700$ range that only runs on integrated graphics it’s just not worth the money.

Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in. Looks like a nice expensive paperweight.  The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box. Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around. After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptop.Decided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra $100 after the price went up. Customer service was not accommodating in the least.  The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time. Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again.

I’ve only had this product for a day and about to take it on a trip, I’ll update if anything goes wrong but here it goes.1. Saw a lot of reviews about the laptop box arriving in a way larger box with a piece of paper used as “stuffing” this is correct… the laptop was shaking all around and I was nervous however the laptop box itself was very well packaged but Amazon could have done a lot more, easy way would just be use some bubble rap or even a lot more of the paper used to secure it.2. Opened everything up and I went to turn it on and nothing …. Kinda made me nervous but I plugged it in and it fired right up, after going through the whole setup and landing at the desktop I could see that the battery was at 80%. I think they enable it so you have to plug it in the first time you use it since it connects to the internet and does updates so that makes sense.3.  Right after going through the long tedious setup process the very first thing I did was go to settings and search for “reset”, from there you tell it to download a new copy of windows and let it do its thing. That way it gets rid of Norton and all the bloatware installed and you get a fresh vanilla copy of windows.4. Got everything back up and even installed a few games and so far everything has been great, no issues with screen, keyboard or anything else.5.  The picture of the laptop looks kinda goofy and I didn’t want this weird computer but for the price I said let’s try it. It looks very professional and it’s actually a great design In person, very sleek and everything is in the perfect spot including the charging port in the back.

From a 3D Game Artist: Best Affordable Gaming Laptop
","
I am Game Artist. I use 3D modeling and game engine programs like Unity, 3DsMax, Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal. I also play plenty of MMORGs and Steam games in my (very little) free-time. And I really needed a new work/personal gaming laptop as my last Acer Predator was starting to degrade after several years of constant use. So I decided to try the Nitro since I really liked the Predator and have an Acer monitor as well.So here's my thoughts:DISPLAYThis is something very important to me being an artist. And the colors are accurate and vivid. I don't have any issue editing my art as I switch displays. It can also get quite bright, nothing too eye burning (I keep it on the lower side) and the screen itself is quite large, and visible even from 2 feet away on a desk.PROCESSOR SPEED / RAM / GPUUsing Unity and Unreal, this laptop has been able to handle my beefy VFX work without issue. Same with my of my 3D Modeling and 3D Sculpting work which can be quite demanding on the GPU. Although the RAM is on the low-medium side so I will be looking into getting an additional one so things run a little faster.STORAGEI upgraded on hard-drive storage when it came to this laptop and I'm so glad I have. All those programs I listed above + PC games can take up a lot of space and I have not had an issue needing to delete something in order to do something else.HARDWARE DESIGNIts nice, sleek, and simple. Very similar to the 2018 Predator I have. The keyboard does light up, which I always like but you can not program custom colors (which is no issue for me but good to know). The only other thing is that this is a LARGE laptop. It is larger than my last one and I really like it being this size for the display. It luckily does fit in my laptop bag but I would make sure to measure yours to make sure this will work for you.PRICEBuying a laptop will always be an expense, especially a gaming laptop. But for the storage space, display quality, and RAM, this laptop is a great deal for $1,200.FINAL THOUGHTSIts been 2 months since Ive been using this laptop and I have had a great experience. Gamer or Artist, I would definitely recommend.

Many people have complaints about the computer not working upon arrival. The quick start manual does cover the problem of putting in the power plug. You need to follow those simple directions. The complaints about the microphone or the headphone port not working are due to the default windows 11 software settings.  You need to mess about with various settings to get them to work.  This information should be in the startup guide.  There is also a user manual that can be downloaded from Acer. The manual has some good points but needed to go into more depth. Some folks complain about the product being damaged in transit.  The box that the computer comes in is of good quality (perhaps it has been recently improved)..  The outer package (the one that Amazon provides) needs more protective foam or bubble wrap around the computer box. Some people complained in other reviews about the heat output from the computer -- it runs so hot that they needed a cooling mat. In normal operation the variable speed cooling fans ('coolboost') seem to do a good job of handling the heat. However, if you are running computer calculation intensive programs you will need to look for a cooling mat. You can easily tell when the computer is getting too hot -- the cooling fans speed up and you can feel the heat coming out of the exhaust ports. In normal operation the computer draws about 65 watts and in heavy use it is less than 100 watts. ALERT: The ""coolboost"" software works for Windows 10 but as soon as you update to Windows 11 the software stops working. I called the Acer repair service and they said that the problem will be fixed in an update but that update is not going to be available until April. The power supply is a ""stepmode"" type and that is very good if you need to run your computer ""off the grid.""  The power supply works with voltages from 100VAC to 220 VAC and from 50 to 60 cps.  The stepmode power supply can deal with the rather high total harmonic distortion (THD) produced by a standby generator.  Overall, this  17 inch computer is well worth the price (($1199).

My Alien finally died on me and I was at a loss.  After a decent amount of grieving time, I decided it was time to start looking for a new PC.  I am pretty picky about my computers since I do a lot of gaming.  I after reading the reviews on this one, and decided it sounded pretty decent despite a couple of negative reviews about the keyboard.I have some tactile issues and I am very, very picky about my keyboard.  I will say that the keyboard on this PC is what surprised me the most.  I LOVE IT!  It gives the perfect resistance when the keys are pressed (it's like a very nice 'smooth click'), the keys are actually not flat but very slightly curved, and well placed.The games I have played so far have all run seamlessly.  I haven't loaded all of them yet, but so far, so good!  The extra fan (cooling system) on the PC is pretty fantastic.So far, I am very happy with this purchase.

Best laptop for your money, if memory ain't an issue...
","
Basically, the best budget computer. Yeah, including Desktops.You're telling me I can buy a gaming computer that outperforms AND replaces Xbox, can be used on the go, and only costs 800$?? That's amazing. Gaming laptops have never been more affordable, and powerful, all at once. Half the price of your standard gaming laptops, without the assembly of a gaming desktop.Enough gushing, though. It's not perfect. At this price, you can play generally any of the standard games with only minor problems. I played Halo Infinite and Modern Warfare well, loading faster than my Xbox buddies, but some menu navigation issues here and there were difficult to ignore. These games themselves run very well, but really push your computer's GPU, which means don't expect to play high end games for long without charging. That is to be expected.The material that makes this computer aren't the best, but good for the money. It's not the most delicate computer, but maybe don't go crazy and throw it or spill anything on it. It's a bit heavy if you plan to vibe out in bed or on the couch. Definitely don't game with this thing on your lap. Keyboard is so-so. Maybe don't eat over this computer unless you are okay with crumbs in the keyboard. Speakers are fantastic in my opinion. You can connect some Bluetooth speakers or earphones easily if you think otherwise.The AN515 model, the cheaper 800$ish you're likely looking at, you'll gonna lacking in RAM and SSD memory. It's not the end of the world...who am I kidding? 250gb SSD? That's way to small! Maybe consider the models with more RAM and Storage. They can run between 1000-1200$, but if you can afford it, or upgrade the RAM and storage yourself, it makes a world of difference. The most you'll need is an external HDD, which is maybe 80$ for 1tb. Still cheaper than most laptops and desktops.The Nitro 5 is definitely the best computer for a budget or if you're starting out and want a computer you can play right out the box. This can replace your Xbox, or a spare Xbox when you have friends over. This plays the majority of PC games at good resolution and framerate.  As a casual laptop for websurfing, videos, programming, Photoshop, you're in good hands, and can be easily upgraded if RAM or memory is an issue. Think of it as a portable desktop, or even a portable Xbox. You won't be disappointed, especially at this price. Great for newcomers.

couple of things
","
Got this machine for my kids for general use and gaming.  There were a few negative Amazon reviews which I wanted to add some perspective to - in case it helps someone.1) The packaging was excellent for the laptop itself.  In its original ACER box, it has 1.5 - 2 inches of high density foam protecting the laptop.  Honestly, I think the laptop could be shipped in this packaging alone and be fine.  I did get 2 laptops and both were boxed together (both acer boxes were shipped in a larger box).  While they were not packed tightly, they arrived undamaged (no box chafing, dents, or slashes)2) The male end of the power supply which plugs into the back of the laptop must be firmly pressed until it clicks.  There is a detent which I had missed initially, until I pressed harder.  You know its fully seated when it clicks, but also when the blue charge light goes on.  Without having the power supply fully seated, you will not be able to power on the device.  I could imagine someone receiving the laptop and thinking it was DOA because they did not fully seat the connector.I've had a total of 6 ACER laptops in my household (all have been hassle free machines).  We'll see how durable they are, but based on my first impression of prior history with this brand, I would buy this product again.

The I-5 10 Series is a video editing and gaming killer! 💯Great hardware to get you in to the 2020's! I've use Devinci Resolve 18 (Free) to edit my GoPro 9 and Sony FDR-X3000 vloggs. It even handles 4k editing which is expected with this powerful processor! 8GB RAM is decent but i put anotger 8GB into the machine, which was really easy to assemble and disassemble.1080p editing is breeze! 💯👍I also have Steam and a few games like War Thunder and I'm able to play with 60fps, easy, high graphics on every setting, no problem. I don't play the newest top notch games but this could handle it, unlike some other commebts kinda under dogging this machine.I boosted the storage with an extra  1TB M.2 Samsung SSD (amazon) for the extra storage capacity.PC fan run while plugged in can be a tad loud, nothing you have to talk over, graphics these days arnt Galaga, almost everything use CPU and RAM, best thing to do, make sure your ram and extra sroage have heatsink. Get a laptop stand but never run the extra fan. Just packs extra dust into the machine. I have one just as a base for better bresthing of my own laptop.The keyboard is also quite nice. I don't mind the short stokes, my fingers glade across like a gizzle.Just make sure to lower the keyboard brightness (helps with battery)Windows 11 isn't bad either, they did it right, has a Mac-ish feel, i like it. Quick and snappy!Win 11 also comes with a video editor as well which now lets you edit 1080p videos for free!Another Mac move 👍 Which is fine! Not complaining!The computer is super snappy, it's got a badass look to it, it's not heavy by any means! It's a low profile, not flat, it needs room for fans ect..The battery great as long as you follow my settings advice.And think of this laptop like a manual car, you have to change settings constantly. If your just browsing on battery they have to be set one way. If your about to get on some video editing then set the otherI'm very please, with extra parts my total was $967.Absolutely love my new Acer Nitro 5!!Battery Settings1.

I am currently playing Ark on this laptop as well as Sims 4. I can easily run both on decently high settings. I'm glad I decided to go with the 16gb of ram instead of the 8. Everything is as expected. My only complaint is the battery does die extremely fast while gaming. Which seems to be a common problem in gaming laptops, although I'm talking like 45 minutes from full battery to low playing the Sims, which is even worse then I was expecting. But I mostly just game places where I can plug it in anyways so this isn't a huge issue. But keep that in mind if that's something that would be a problem for you.

I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050. I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn't gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you'll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall, this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me. If you are going to buy a laptop for any reason, might as well get a gaming one like this!

Bought it couple of days back and the laptop did not boot at all. I almost returned my laptop when I read a comment suggesting to push the pin all the way in at the backside of laptop until an audible click is heard. It worked and rest of the experience was smooth.

Laptop is not dead

I bought this laptop after seeing several negative feedback from people who received the laptop dead because it would not turn on, the same thing happened to me, I connected it and nothing happened, however it is not a defect of the laptop, you have to connect the cable strongly until click and it will turn on, I was about to return it and ask for a refund, but everything is fine.

Excellent Value Gaming Laptop
","
Good sub-$1000 gaming laptops are hard to find, but The Nitro 5 gives great value without breaking the bank.  The 10th Gen Core i5 processor is 2 generations old at this point, but it has plenty of power to run pretty much all modern games at a decent setting.  The Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics processor is an entry level to the new Ray-Tracing sexiness that's the next big thing in graphics.  On newer games you probably won't be able to get past the 60fps barrier at 1080p with the settings cranked, but dialing the details down a bit will give you better rates. The display is rated for 1080p and 144hz, and while it's not the brightest or most vibrant screen out there, it's fine for this price point.  There is also a (full size) HDMI out, but I have not had occasion to connect this to an external monitor yet.  The cooling fans do a good job of keeping this machine within temp specs... but do note they can get pretty loud under load (honestly that's almost inevitable on a gaming laptop, it's hard to keep things cool in such a small box. Anyone who games on a laptop should invest in a good headset IMHO.)I have opened this computer up to install a few upgrades (more on that below) and I will say I'm pretty impressed with the build quality for a computer in this segment.  The components are reputable makes rather than mystery off-brands (WD for the SSD, looks like Micron on the single 8gb RAM stick.) All the panels fit together nice and go back together easily after disassembly, making upgrades something you don't have to dread.Speaking of those upgrades... for a computer at this price point you have to live with a few compromises and here is where they may be found.  The storage this model comes with is a paltry 256gb m.2 drive... If you do plan on gaming on the Nitro, either be ready to upgrade this quickly or learn to love delete-ing and re-installing games and apps constantly.  Fortunately, there is a second un-used m.2 PCIe slot on the motherboard to accommodate an upgrade (this processor and motherboard supports PCIe up to gen-3 speeds.) There is also an open 2.5 inch bay for an SSD. Memory-wise, this unit comes with a single 8gb DDR4 SODIMM RAM stick installed.  This should be fine for most gaming- if you don't run big apps in the background-  but since this has two slots total for an upgrade I removed it and installed 2 8gb sticks of Kingston FURY Impact DDR4 RAM,  just for a bit of extra headroom (the max speed the i5 10300H will operate memory at is 2933 Mhz, so it's not worth it to spend more on faster RAM.)All in all, this is a fine machine for someone who's interested in a good no-fuss entryway into PC gaming, or a seasoned gamer who wants an inexpensive but capable machine to go mobile with. Highly Recommended!

I wanted a really good laptop to replace my aging one whose battery was fubar. A new battery would be over a hundred dollars and I'd still have an 8 year old machine.I'm a writer (check out my ebooks at garyalanhenson.blogspot.com) and I love games, mostly FPSs and RTS games.I also make Point and Click games and I play with Doom Builder 2 to make retro 3D games.The 17 inch screen is AWESOME!. The lighted keyboard is cool though not really needed. One thing that surprised me is there is no CD player. I ordered an external one so that I can load my old games and game tools.The machine boots in less than 2 seconds and shuts down just as fast!Gaming: blew me away! I downloaded Serious Sam 4, which has insane machine requirements and it runs it in full EVERYTHING mode! The game doesn't recognize the new 3060 video card but will still play the game.The internet speed is incredible! On my 500M wifi net this machine is getting 450M!!!! My old machine struggled to get 50M on the same wifi.Now to find a carrying case so I can take it to my favorite coffee shop on the mornings when I write!

Very good for the price :)

This is my first laptop after a decade and I am very happy to purchase this one. So many good words about Nitro 5s, even this one is not one of the better ones, I added another 8Gb ram and 2 TB 2.5 SSD to make it bit more usable. Not that anything wrong with 8Gb ram and 256Gb SSD but 8Gb rams are not that expensive at all these days.. I had 2TB SSD from my big computer, just switched it over. Talking about upgrading the laptop, it's so easy. Comes with everything you need to add another 2.5 SSD. YouTube videos helped me out though, made my job a lot easier. This computer does play FPS games, and plays them very smooth. The fans start running though, and you might think it's overheating, that's not the case, it's normal. They don't go full speed. I also play mobile games and stream through laptop... no heating no fan issues at all... it's like so smooth and easy for the machine. For this price, I highly recommend it, if you are in a tight budged like I am. One more thing for this laptop, I am going to travel Europe next year, and it won't be problem bringing it with me, since it is travel friendly :)

I got a lemon. Returning and eagerly awaiting a second (functional) unit.
","
UPDATE (22 March 2022):New unit arrived yesterday and started up perfectly.As for a laptop, it's perfectly functional. The design is nice, the keyboard feels nice (trackpad takes some getting used to clicking), there are enough ports for the peripherals I use, and it's run older games for 5 hours straight with negligible heat. I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5___________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives.

An excellent option for limited budget!
","
So, I was tracking it's price for a few months and it reached it lowest price in Black Friday so I didn't hesitate. After almost six months of use I'm really glad of the results, I bought it mostly for work, present content in virtual meetings while having some programs running. Since the beginning I only ran a few games (Halo Infinite and Destiny) because the storage is a huge limitation, but after a few months I bought an extra ssd plus 8gb for ram and the results are really admirable. Must games run smoothly at high definition (not top but four out of five) and in some more demanding games you can still play in good quality. Lately I plugged it to the tv (standard Samsung) to play a little more comfortable and my experience has been really pleasant. No crashes until now. I've tried RE2, DBZ Fighterz, COD and FIFA22.

CPU Benchmark tests put this top 3. M/P ratio of 7.7. 144hz screen is solid (although it could benefit from being a bit brighter.Onboard sound is ok...not really DTS. GPU can handle quite a bit and runs VR smoothly on medium to upper settings.Construction seems pretty decent. I am more of a fan of aluminum casings, bit this rig feels sturdy. The case does show every little fingerprint, so that is kinda annoying.Power connection is on the back (which is perfect for me). I wish the RJ-45 and HDMI were located there as well.Overall, and very good gaming rig for the price point.

Best bang for your buck! AVOID WINDOWS 11!!!
","
Had purchased this same PC with Windows 11. It was a train wreck from the first power up. Almost everything I did (attempt to install any game, load any game, uninstall, etc) resulted in at best the game crashing to desktop or at worst BSOD. This happened constantly, the computer became unusable. Promptly returned and ordered the same laptop except with Windows 10. It is WORLDS better. For me, W11 was a total disaster; most modern games just don't play nice with it.For the flight simmers out there, this laptop is what you need. MSFS 2020 runs at 30fps+ with all settings on ultra, but on high settings it will do 40-50fps+ even in urban areas like ATL, MIA, etc. Xplane-11 runs unbelievably well, getting 100+fps with moderate to high settings. The ""Nitro"" button is a huge plus, allowing you to control fan speed and check CPU/GPU temps instantly; on max RPM the fans are certainly noticeable, but it's music to my ears. Can't lose with this machine, Acer hit a homerun with the W10 version.

My 12 Year Old Loves It!
","
This is a great entry gaming laptop for my 12 year old who will be 13 next month. The colors and graphics are great, he loves the lighted keyboard, and this definitely has a bit of weight which contributes to the sturdiness. I also like that it’s also just a great laptop as well. We were able to upgrade for Windows 11 for free.  At home, he now uses this computer vs the school assigned Chrome, for his Zoom math tutoring sessions (the camera and microphone is decent we still use a separate microphone), and to also complete his homework on Google classroom.Other features: I also like the number of inputs which has more than my Lenovo X1 Carbon ThinkPad, and the  ability to wirelessly connect the laptop to your tv as a second extended screen is pretty cool.Overall this was a present for his good grades, and it also works great for homework assignments and video conferencing as added bonuses.

3 months in and it still seems to be running great

I had this laptop about 3 months now and everything still seems to be doing pretty good. the temp never went over 200 degrees F... but I do have it on a cooling pad, and I turn the internal cooling fans on the highest settings with the nitro sense when i play something somewhat intensive and I don't play many intensive games. the I5 core will most likely have a rough time playing the latest games but it will run something like escape from tarkov like butter at 75 to over 100 fps in ultra-settings. you might want to get another 8gig stick of ram to pop in and upgrade the ssd storage but over all I'm very satisfied for what this computer is and can do. it is my very first gaming laptop and I feel it somewhat replaced my xbox. for someone who's never had a dedicated laptop for gaming or a computer at all, I feel this is one of the best first steps into pc gaming.

Amazing budget laptop

This laptop is 100% worth the money. I did a lot of research into many many different laptops, specifically in the $600-$900 range, and this was the one I went with. And I’m very glad I did. I bought it mainly for gaming and it works like a charm. Just some examples: 150+ FPS on Fortnite with high performance graphics, 250+ FPS on Rocket League with high performance graphics, 300+ FPS on Minecraft (default “fancy” graphics), 200+ FPS on Forza Horizon with high graphics. I’ve had absolutely no problems with it as far as gaming goes, and it works great for any daily work you may want to use it for. Note that I did add an extra 8gb of crucial ram into the open slot, which does improve performance. The only slight issue it has is that the fans can be a bit loud for more intensive games or programs. However, that’s the case for many budget gaming laptops. Some good headphones will do the trick if it gets to be a problem. But like I said, this laptop is exactly what I was looking for and if you’re looking for a good gaming laptop in the $800 price range, this is it.

Best Bang for your Buck
","
I'm an architecture student and I bought this laptop as I needed an affordable but powerful laptop to run some of the architectural software (Revit, Inventor, etc) while on the go. The dedicated 3050 comes in handy when rendering finished models and the CPU is beefy enough to handle all the processing requirements these programs take.While the i5 is great for my own needs I would recommend going with the i7 if you can afford the extra costs. I haven't found a laptop yet that can beat the performance this offers at this price.However here are some drawbacks and considerations.The screen quality is great but the backlight shows slightly and the color seems a bit off compared to when I link the screen to another monitor. Maybe that's a user error, but its a noticeable difference from when I look at the same image on another screenTerrible battery life. Make sure you always have a charging cord handy and don't expect it to last the entirety of a long flight. The battery last around 4 hours with light usage. 3 hours if I'm rendering or designing. If power-saving mode is enabled you can extend this time frame at the cost of performance.Low Storage and mediocre ram. Luckily these issues can be mitigated. Additional storage slots for SSD and HHD are available to increase storage capacity. The RAM is acceptable for what I need, however, if you plan on rendering large projects or want to play some AAA games you'll want to upgrade these features.I'm very happy with my purchase.

At this price, you'll have a hard time finding the same raw power anywhere else. So far, I've played No Man's Sky and Planetside 2 (at default settings) with no framerate issues that I can notice. Minecraft with RTX also works. It has a few framerate hiccups, but I've seen the same from some desktop RTX cards.The screen is nice. The colors aren't washed out by the backlight, like in other laptops, and the higher refresh rate makes everything feel liquidy smooth.A big factor that drives the price down is, of course, the storage. The more modern games you'll probably want to play on this machine are usually 50+ GB in size, and at that rate, the 250 GB hard drive is going to fill up in no time. Just remember that the storage is extremely upgradeable--another feature that's hard to find in laptops at this price point. Don't need a ton of storage? Great, enjoy the low price. Need more storage? The option's there for you when you're ready.P.S. I was wary at first, because Acer has a bit of a ""you get what you pay for"" reputation. But I've had it for about a month now, and haven't encountered any issues. I also purchased the 4-year protection plan, just in case.

Best Budget Gaming Laptop

This is, by far, the best gaming laptop if you are on a budget.I bought the second option (i5 w/ RTX 3050) and it runs a lot of the heavy games I play (Sims4 on High, The Forest on High, Minecraft on max). The Coolboost system kicks on automatically if you reach temperatures of 80C+ (which is normal for gaming laptops by the way)The fact that they include a HDD upgrade cable is also a major plus, I was able to easily put in a new HDD.The upgrade requires a 2.5"" HDD instead of the popular 3.5"" HDD, which can be pricy, but definitely no issue here.The light up keyboard is cool, but I just turn mine down to off most of the time I use it.My only gripe with it is the touchpad is a bit sensitive to touch, no matter how you adjust the sensitivity. I had to turn off the scrolling/zooming features because I was doing it so often without meaning to. This might just be user error, but that's basically it.Definitely a good buy if you are on a budget!

Okay so the title of this review maybe misleading, but I noticed this is one of the biggest issue with this machine, it even got me the first time. Had to order a replacement. When that came in same issue no power.The REASON for this is the way ACER has set up the new power cord to be more secure. It actually requires you to push it in until you hear a click. The connector will be completely flush with the back of the laptop. If you look at it and see light between laptop and connector keep pushing, it is not yet connected.As for laptop for casual/new gamers, this one is good for the price.

I am a tech savy guy and nothing I can do can get this touchscreen working again. ChromeOS doesn't even give you touchscreen options in the settings, you think an OS from the company that makes Android (Google) would have atleast some touchscreen settings.

The second one was working fine for a week - we did not use the Chromebook for couple of week and then when we opened it the touch screen does not respond .. AGAIN !!!! As it has been more than a month, Amazon refuses to refund (they want to charge 15% fee). I called up Lenovo service, spent an hour with them over the phone and they asked me to send it back to their factory for repairing.The time I had to spend so far on this is enormous. It is causing problem for my daughter's study.DO NOT EVER GO FOR IT.I think I will go for the refund (85% of the original price) rather than repairing it - just to get rid of this crap !!!I RETURNED THE PRODUCT TO AMAZON AND HAD TO PAY 15% OF THE PRICE. THIS IS CRAZY - FOR A CRAPPY PRODUCT LIKE THIS I SHOULD HAVE GOT 100% REFUND. THIS PRODUCT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. NOT SURE IF AMAZON OR LENOVO EVER READ THROUGH THE FEEDBACKS. MY MISTAKE WAS I DID NOT USE IT FOR 3 WEEKS AND THAT'S WHY MISSED THE 30 DAY RETURN WINDOW.

No touch screen

Price was right, size was right for my application. I bought it for those reasons and most importantly the touch screen. I do not know if I got a bad one but the one I got does not have touch screen. I noticed it while setting it up but thought it would be available in application. Nope. No touch screen. ?

Touchscreen Not Compatible With ChromeOS 92
","
After updating to ChromeOS 92 the touch screen stops working. Everything else still works.Using a ""powerwash and revert"" to get back to chromeos 87 reenabled the touchscreen. However, ChromeOS updates automatically (and, for security and features you will always want the newest update), so the touch screen being unusable on the latest ChromeOS makes this Chromebook nearly useless.I had this issue on two of these Chromebooks. I returned the first one because I thought it was a hardware defect, but it turns out it is a compatibility issue with the latest version of ChromeOS.

My headline might seem silly, but this Chromebook does what it's supposed to do. I'm retired and don't use a laptop as much as I used to, but I still wanted one. I bought an HP which never worked properly after the Windows 10 install, so it was nice to have something that works nice. I recommend it.

I have had many computers in my life and this one is the best by far.  I love the fact that it is small and I can just throw it into my tote bag or large purse and take it with me anywhere.  The battery lasts 10 or more hours.  My main reason for buying was the specs and the fact that it was not WINDOWS.  Using my Google Account my computer set up in less than 10 minutes.  Using the Google Play store you can find all of your apps and install them.  You will not be disappointed.

First Chromebook and it's a winner
","
First off, the touchscreen works fine.  I'm on version 100.0.4896.133 and had absolutely no issues.  So whatever plagued this model previously has been resolved.  Now then, lets focus on the laptop.The first thing I noticed was the screen.  In an age of almost no bezels....  Holy bezel Batman!  Is this a bad thing?  Eh, maybe to some.  For me I'm OK with it.  Realize the laptop itself is about the size of a 13.3"" laptop.  I haven't looked into it but I suspect there's a laptop in this chassis with a 12"" or 13"" screen.  But in day-to-day use, it's fine for me.  The smaller screen gives a good pixel density and colors look fine.  Very good viewing angles too.  So all in all, I like it.  Touchscreen seems very responsive as well.  No issues at all there.  Oh, and in the bezel there's a webcam.  720p, does OK in low light, no physical shutter so get your stickers ready :PGoing down the laptop we have the hinge.  While I'm not a fan of tablet modes that leave the keyboard exposed, it does what it sets out to do just fine.  The pivoting action feels very smooth with a fair bit of resistance.  Folding over into tablet mode, everything works as expected with good orientation control.  So while something I won't use much, it's a nice feature.Down further, we get to the keyboard.  Keys have a nice feel to them though travel is a bit short.  Not Lenovo's best but certain better than other keyboard I've used.  I'm a little disappointed it doesn't include the usual ""F"" keys given I use Linux on here but so far it's not caused any issues...Finally we come to the touchpad.  I must be honest, I despise most any touchpad without physical buttons.  However, I must confess this one is actually very good.  It's proven to be very responsive with almost no hiccups.  At times I will have a small lag if I try and use two fingers (resting one finger on the ""button"" and moving with the other) but it handles this better than other cheap machines I've dealt with.  The physical action is rather mushy but taps work just as well.Finally, we come to the speakers.  This is probably the weakest part of the whole machine.  I find underside speakers become obstructed way too often.  Of course this depends on how it's used, but I'd much prefer top-mounted speakers.  But judging what we have, they actually works pretty well.  If you're on a hard surface, they have decent sound.  Nothing phenomenal, but about what you'd expect from a machine at this price point.  And then if they are covered, you can still get OK sound from them.I guess the last point will be I/O.  Charging is via USB-C, and yes, this port can be used for other USB devices too.  You also have full-sized HDMI, a USB 3.0 and full-sized SD card slot.  SD cards aren't flush when inserted so that's a bit disappointing, but I'm glad Lenovo at least opted for full sized ports and such.  Now on the adjacent side we have power, volume and a headphone jack...not much to say there.Finally the guts of the beast.  At the heart of this machine is an ARM based processor.  I was very curious how performance would be using ChromeOS and more importantly the Linux dev environment.  Results have been mixed but generally very good.  As a Chromebook for surfing the web and watching videos, it works fine.  Pages load quickly, videos play without issue, etc.  The only hiccup I've found is playing a video in the background.  The video remains frozen for a bit when returning to it, but this is only a minor quibble.  I've not had many issues with Android apps either.  My library is really only productivity software, but it's all worked as expected.  Over on the Linux side, the processor is a bit labored.  Chromium under Linux is obviously slower than the baked in Chrome, but I'm sure Linux running as a VM doesn't help.Lets end on usage, or more specifically heat and battery life.  I've not done any specific testing, but I'd say 10 hours out of this machine wouldn't be difficult at all.  And then even while under a load and charging, there's almost no noticeable heat generated by this laptop.If you're looking for a good all around Chromebook and can overlook the oddly sized screen, I highly recomend this machine!

Works out of the box, then some issues - we returned it
","
It’s too tedious to try and keep this thing running. We returned it today before the deadline. If you enjoy tinkering then maybe this is a solution for you, but we ordered a new iPad instead.I was able to get started right out of the box. Added apps, set up my preferences, etc. the the OS updated and the touchscreen stopped working. I went searching for an answer and the fastest most reliable fix is to change to the Beta (it comes set to Stable) channel which’s skips the ChromeOS version with issue. I did not want to powerwash, I did try the hold the power button for 10 seconds, and I tried holding the reload button while turning it on for a hard reset.As far as the chromebook, this is the newer model we bought him in 2018 (same specs and a lower price). I was under the impression that Android apps for chrome books would be made for tablets, but some I loaded like reolink seem they are for phones and very clunky. Anyway, this one is for my father in law to use.I can easily recommend this one, you will want either a Bluetooth speaker or headphones for any serious listening though.

A Wonderful Chromebook--Fantastic Price
","
For the price, this is probably the best Chromebook on the market.  With a full 360 rotation, it's a great tablet, tent it for movie/tv watching or use it traditionally like a laptop.  Because it is Chrome OS, almost every needed product is available in the Google Play store.  It's lightweight and so easy to carry around.  I purchased a hardshell cover for it, a very thin keyboard cover (to protect the keys from my long nails; nothing worse than the color removed from the keys), a carrying case with a shoulder strap and for extra storage I have a portable thumb drive.  It has onboard storage of 64gb which is extraordinary on a Chromebook.  This is the third one I've purchased:  1 as a gift and 2 for myself (one of which I gave to my grandson for online learning)  You cannot go wrong with this little gem!

A good device, finally after ChromeOS October 2021 update

It is a very affordable device. I was looking for a laptop stable, fast and cheap. I got to this and the fact that the manufacturer sells it as a 2 in 1 chromebook got up the points for making my decision. It was very disappointing when the OS got updated and the touchscreen stopped working. No more 2 in 1, fake! But 0ctober 2021 updated arrived and, finally, fixed the problem allowing me having back my 2 in 1 Chromebook. Of course, having Mediatek processor, 4 Gb RAM doesn't make it a powerful machine but for light-work and watching stream videos and music, make this device a very decent and cheap option to use ChromeOS.

Right off the bat I have purchase two of these so far from the Amazon Warehouse NOT Third Party Sellers because when purchased directly from Amazon you get manufacture support where third party you cannot.One was purchased as Acceptable the other Very Good yet both were like brand new and work great.Performance on and offline is very good, sound loudness is also very good but screen quality even at such a low resolution is excellent, tight, sharp with deep vivid true colors, videos run to 4K  with no issues, while the keyboard and touchpad are also very good.The IPS screen for me is a must have and this one plus touch capability is just icing one the cake.Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.

At the same time my ipad mini 2 is showing an ageing speed.Ordered on 27-Jun selected the global expedited shipping, arrived here in Asia via DHL on 30-Jun before the end of the day, two days faster than the shipping confimation.The packaging is minimum, but still protected by few airbags. Ipad comes with generic box instead of apple certified refurbished one. There is one paper divider to separate the ipad and charger+cable contained below. I wish teh seller could put something to prevent the charger and acble moving inside the box. The provided charger and cable are aftermarket ones, not the usual apple charger+cable.The ipad is protected by thin film, enough to prevent scratches during the shipment. There some small mark and nip fisible. But it doesn’t affect the functionality of the ipad. When power on, there 89% power left. Both cameras, wifi and bluetooth module, all buttons (power, volume, home/touchID) speakers are working fine. The device system is also working well. I’m writing review from it and hope it continues to work find. If you are fine with refurbished product, trade off between appearance vs functionality... then this should be good cost saving purchase.

Arrived completely dead - There is no hope for the product I received
","
I was excited to receive this iPad, but was extremely disappointed when it arrived completely dead...so I hooked it up to the charger that it came with and let it charge for an hour before I planned to set it up....nothing.  The apple logo kept flashing rapidly - I googled how to fix that...no change.  Thought, well maybe it's just really dead (was showing 1% battery after an hour)...I let it charge all night...no change.  I changed the charger with another apple brand charging cable & box....no change.There is zero hope for this thing...I've been monkeying around with it for the better part of my morning, and I'm just done.  The other reviews that are similar to mine I thought were anomalies and were a fluke...I thought wrong.Returning for a full refund; I'll buy from someone else.

I am very happy with my renewed iPad! Works great and will be a good asset this year as my daughter does schoolwork from home.The only hiccup was the initial charger said it was for an iPod, so it wasn't able to charge the iPad passed 40%. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new charger that works great. Overall a very good experience! I would recommend looking at ""renewed"" options when shopping for a new-to-you iPad.

After one month

After having this iPad for over a month I can strongly say that this is a great deal if you need an iPad. It was half the price of buying a new one. I mainly just use it for youtube and browsing the internet and it is great. The previous owner had it engraved so they etched it out. But my iPad had 89% battery life left which is plenty and had no visible marks or scratches on the body when i received it. Overall really pleasant experience.

I bought this as a home replacement when my Mini died. I have purchased refurbished equipment before and like the value. In this case I was a little concerned by some of the reviews indicating screen scratches, bad battery life, etc.  mine arrived sooner than the estimate and was in excellent condition. I would call it like new except for a few very minor scratches on the back likely from a case. The iPad had a protective film on the back and came with a new power cord and 2 amp adapter (aftermarket, I believe).The screen was immaculate and I was able to restore from my old backup easily.Too early to tell on battery life, but so far so good.

First time buying refurbished on Amazon and an iPad would normally be the last thing I’d consider, but my usage is very light and specific so with the mindset of how bad could it really be, I took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. It has no visible cosmetic imperfections, nicks or scratches. At normal usage angle, the screen is perfect. I have to hold it slanted against light to see the very light usage scratches and it’s really not scratches at all.The body has no nicks, the buttons are all clean and responsive. It was obvious that the last owner kept it in a case. No issues with battery or charging, this thing looks and feels like new. Five stars.

I picked up this iPad to use as a hub for my smart home set up. More and more, however, I’ve been finding myself reaching for this over my laptop for browsing and watching videos. I’m even writing this review on it right now. iPadOS has completely changed the way the iPad functions and has made it come that much closer to being a viable replacement for a laptop. Even this budget, refurbished iPad works amazingly with the updated software. This does not come with the newest software preinstalled, so be sure to download it as soon as you get it. Out of the box this thing looks great. It does not come with the original box, but besides a single scratch on the bottom corner you would have no idea this wasn’t brand new. I’m very happy with this iPad.

I have a Gen 1(!) iPad and needed to upgrade the hardware because the apps were not supporting an OS that old, so it was time to make a decision.  I use it for mostly reading books and carrying documents easily, so I started looking at Kindles as well as iPads and other tablets.  In the end, it cost me an extra $30, give or take, to go from a new Kindle Paperwhite to a refurbished Gen5 iPad.  The Gen1 was never very good at using the internet, always dropping out, pretty slow... so I never used it mush for that.Well, this machine came a day early and was in pristine condition. The charger is an off-brand one that works just fine. Aside from the pain and agony of trying to get all my files moved over (thanks Apple!), the iPad works flawlessly, and is very fast.  I can watch live TV or fiddle with Facebook in bed now!I cannot be more satisfied with the device I received.

Makes for a great mini-laptop with iPad OS
","
I use this with a cheap Bluetooth keyboard that turns this iPad into a small laptop. The screen has a nice HD display, battery life is great, and gets my basic note taking done in lecture. Multitasking is nice, and the pop out window with Netflix and Hulu allows me to binge my shows even while still using the split screen function (so essentially triple tasking). iPad OS revolutionizes how iPad works, you don’t need an app for everything to work anymore. Safari browsing is much better and you can natively save and load files onto the iPad itself without using Google Drive, iCloud, or any other storage app. Great buy and I would recommend it for a low weight and decently powered laptop alternative

In order to avoid spending over $300 USD on a new IPAD I decided to buy a used one, the 2017 version. I needed an operating system that was at least 10 to run the Vox Tone Room app, and my IPAD 2 maxed at 9. The IPAD I received was a little dented and scratched in the back but the glass was perfect and the new case I bought hides everything else. The IPAD came with a clean setup and IOS 12.4 installed. The battery life has been great and no problems with any of the pre-installed applications. The item came in the white box with a new charging cable, but was clearly marked as refurbished.

I teach and,  like the previous model I bought, will take this in place of a lap-top which, at age 77, is much less convenient for me due to its added weight.

This definitely isn't anything you want to be gaming on because the CPU usage just gets so high. Mind you, it would get to 99% CPU usage with no apps open, only running the chrome browser with ONE tab open watching Netflix. I bought this just for basic usage of online browsing, watching Netflix or YouTube, checking emails, listen to music (the speakers are a bit low, wish it was a little louder) and just again very basic things. It did crash on me once while again just one tab opened watching Netflix. It would react to my clicking but it was very delayed and slow. Sometimes moving the cursor around is also a little delayed so it doesn't have the best reaction time when clicking on something. It's not touch screen and no backlit keyboard but it wasn't something I was personally interested in and I don't believe it mentions it in the ads either. Arrived next day and it's very lightweight, does feel a little like cheapish plastic so be careful moving the screen back and forth but the overall packaging was nice and new. You get what you pay for and I really wasn't expecting much from it. If you buy this with LOW expectations and for simple/basic use then it's a great little Chromebook. I've deleted all extra apps that came preinstalled that I personally didn't need and made sure everything is updated and clean. Sometimes your Chrome extensions can make Chrome use up a lot of CPU so be on the lookout for that (I decided to remove some extensions but yet the Chromebook does still take up a lot of space). Overall a great little Chromebook for travel but just don't expect anything crazy or anything like a laptop. This isn't a laptop, its a Chromebook. So no Windows OS just Chrome. Think of it like an android tablet with a keyboard really lol keeping those things in mind and making sure not too many things are running at a time, you'll have a good experience with it!

Nice little laptop

I really like this computer..I just use it for fantasy sports on Yahoo and some other web surfing but I really like it.. I've previously owned larger HP ones and I wanted to go with something different and a chrome operating system because I am tired of windows and their non stop updates.. First of all battery life is excellent, once you close the computer it sleeps and uses almost zero battery, then when you open it it's immediately ready to use, doesn't have to boot up or anything. Also the charging port is the same upside down or right side up! You don't have to fiddle with the port to rightly plug it in.  Important to note, set-up was a little tricky as you have to sign in as a user/ owner to take it out of ""guest mode"" which allows you to bookmark your favorite pages to immediately have access to your faves, that involves setting up a Google Gmail account or using an existing one u have, other than that it's a handy, simple unit that is very well worth the price.  I suggest googling the process if you are unsure.. I'm not very computer savvy but I figured it out in a matter of minutes 😁 I recommend this computer.. The mousepad is also a simple tool, which has left click and right click on the pad without extra buttons so you will have to get used to that I do suggest maybe getting an actual mouse and mousepad because the panel is a little tricky to navigate other than that a great 👍 item

My 6 year older Sunsung Chromebook is better
","
There is a benefit or two to this Chromebook, I swear, but one for sure being the weight. Much lighter than my older Samsung Chromebook XE500C12.But, that's all I can say. It bogs down and barely functions - all mouse or key inputs 30-45 seconds delayed, sometimes more. Either working on a document or scrolling a bland website becomes impossible without having to close down everything and restarting.I've gone online and tried to research why this is and tried refreshing the page using SHIFT + CTRL + R, but that doesn't do any good either. It honestly feels like the RAM is malfunctioning or like there's something in the background limiting it's ability to think. My 6 year older Samsung (built in 2015) never has this issue and boasts much smaller resources than this Asus; much less Ram and such.I got this on Treasure Truck and getting reviews on those things are hard to come by. Now, I can't wait to return this item, that I couldn't read reviews on (to be fair, only one other person mentioned freezing in their review) just to pay a restocking fee. Hopefully they fix this thing, but it already feels like a crappy refurb, so not sure what they're gonna do with it.

It's not touchscreen, so I can't rate that.  The screen is bright enough, but the thing I'm most impressed is with the sound.

Truly worthless. Stopped working after 3 months - literally, I was in the middle of a Zoom call and it just shut down and wouldn't turn on again. I sent it in to Asus for repairs under the warranty. They claim it was my fault (how??? I never dropped or otherwise damaged this computer, it was literally sitting on a desk when it stopped working abruptly) without giving any information about how I supposedly caused this damage and said it would be about $90 to repair it. For a $130 chromebook that was 3 months old! Ridiculous. Don't waste your money, your warranty will NOT be honored. It's priced so low for a reason - its lifespan is apparently only 3 months.

I figured 4GB of RAM would be sufficient just for day to day use. I was a bit disappointed in 128GB of storage and decided that even though it was a really nice machine for the price, for another $80 and change I could really make it fly.. if you look at my photos you can see that there's built in space for a 2.5 in SATA drive. In addition there is room to add memory and I decided to add another 8GB of RAM along with the SATA drive and 480 GB of storage. Obviously it makes a huge difference. If you look at the pictures I posted you can see that the Acer storage is depleted by half as soon as you turn the machine on. The Steve drive is the one that I installed. Plenty of storage now. The circled in red photo shows the increase in RAM... WHEN LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS be aware that this model came out back in May of this year. There are very few instructional videos or written pieces to explain where this memory goes. The SATA drive is pretty self-explanatory. The only video I could find with this particular machine is provided by a user whose name is.   @Silicon Edge   you have to go to YouTube and search that name. I don't believe Amazon would allow me to post a link. It's not in English but all you have to do is watch his hands. If you try other videos you might think it's the machine you've bought until you open the back of yours and you look at the back of theirs and realize that it's different. I highly recommend temporarily taking out the screw on your right side of the battery to secure the ribbon clip. Then just readjust the battery and put the screw back in. Watch the video you'll know exactly what I mean. I love this computer. For $460 including the new ram I upgraded this machine. It would have cost me way more than that to buy it with that memory and that storage from scratch. Quick PS. I bought an HP 27 inch monitor here on Amazon and created a nice little setup. $169. You'll love the machine Don't think twice just buy it. If you want some speed, I mean real speed just upgrade the RAM and the storage. I used crucial. That's the brand name for the SATA and the RAM..... READ ABOUT THE UPGRADES..... You don't want to perform Overkill. The processor wasn't made for it. I'm no techie so I did a lot of reading before I did this.

Fine laptop, suits my needs perfectly but I did add memory to it.
","
I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this laptop. It seemed like a good computer for the price. Many if the reviews said it was short on memory. It has a SSD drive but it is a bit on the small side, and the built in ram was lacking at only 4 gb. There is an open slot for ram and a space for a second hard drive already there. The company included a pack of hard drive screws with a web site to instruct you on how to install a second drive. Since I had a like new 1tb laptop drive and a 8gb memory card laying around, I waisted no time. The upgrade was simple.Honestly, I have no complaints with this laptop. Some people complained about the screen. I don't know why, it's very clear to me. Battery life is fine, but I am just a home user so I am not on it for hours at a time. The speakers point down from under the computer, but I can still hear what I need to so no big deal to me. I even don't mind the touch pad on this one (hated the one on my last computer).If you are a gamer or someone who needs a super powerful computer for intense graphics, this probably isn't your best choice. But for home use, I am very happy with this laptop and would certainly recommend it.

Llego rápido a Chile, el peso es en termino medio ni tan ligero ni tan pesado. Es muy bonita la laptop tiene la pantalla full HD, 1920x1080, es rápida con el i3 11th, viene con 4gb de ram soldada + una ranura adicional para agregarle ram ddr4 Sodimm, recomiendo una ram de 3200 o 2666 1.2v, ya que el procesador es muy rápido te andará muy bien. Por si te preocupa el cargador en Chile no hay problema funciona re bien. El teclado es la versión US sin la ñ, igual en el Windows le colocas teclado latinoamericano y la tecla derecha de la ""L"" la reconoce como Ñ. Recomiendo esta laptop por su precio a mi me costo en total total 323mil pesos Chilenos para trabajar en programación, ofimática, clases online, etc. No la recomiendo para jugar a menos que incrementes la Ram, pero juegos como LoL y Valorant funcionan bien en gráficos bajos. El sonido es lo normal por el precio no tendrás un sonido detallista. En resumen la laptop es muy rápida, buena, bonita, buen sistema de refrigeración, lo malo es la Ram y el almacenamiento de 128 (al momento de ocuparla solo tienes 80gb libres es urgente que compres un HDD o SSD) yo tengo un hdd de 1TB de 5200 rpm, funciona bastante fluido nada que decir. El i3 11th puedes compararlo en la pagina versus por si estas inseguro, yo los compare e hice benchmark y es un procesador bastante rápido en mono núcleo, pero con una ram adicional esta laptop es una bestia.

Whenever the laptop enters idle state or the lid is closed for a few minutes, the laptop becomes unresponsive.  The screen is black, no keyboard or mouse input is accepted, and the fan makes a surging sound.  In order to use the computer, the power button must be held down for 10 seconds to perform a hard reset.  This means that every single time I go to use the laptop, it must be first powered down, powered up, rebooted in order to function.  I tried restoring factory settings which removed all non-included applications.  The issue remained after resetting to factory state.

I added 8 Gb RAM in the single open memory slot, and a 1 Tb hard-disk drive for user files -- reserving the SSD for the operating system alone.

This laptop is my first, and great for what little I do on it: social media, email, games...things like that. I'm over 70 and got it up and running myself, although my 20 year old grandson did all the technical things for me. He loves it, so it must be good. It doesn't have a touch screen so I ordered an Acer wireless mouse. I'm happy with both the mouse and laptop so far. I can't comment on the battery life since I use it only a couple of hours a day.

I bought this laptop in June for my sister, who is a school teacher.  She used it lightly over the summer and then for one week, in class, last week (second week of August)and it over heated and now it won't run.  Amazon no longer has a 90 Day guaranty, only a 30 day.The call center lady wanted to help me, but could not ,because she did not have the authorization. All she could do was give me the phone number of the manufacturer, who would not answer their phone.Frankly I am shocked at this.  This is the third Acer I have bought for my sister. In the past, they each lasted 3 years with heavy, classroom use. But not this one.Caveat Emptor

I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.PROS --Incredible Price to Performance RatioVery well built, with no cheap partsFull-size, comfortable keyboardSmall and lightweightGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatwareInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slotI could keep going... it's $200.CONS --No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)Some irksome viewing angle problemsMaddeningly little built in storageAlmost too little RAMRealtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):Introduction (above)Weight & BuildKeyboard and TrackpadScreenBatteryPerformance (including Gaming)WebcamSpeakers & SoundSoftwareLinuxOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)ConclusionLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.With that being said, let me get into the details.WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.SPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.

It worth the price.  Empty slot for adding a second SSD drive (NVME M.2)
","
I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal.  It is  like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core.  Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy.  I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance).  The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year).  After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch.  The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage.  I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2.  I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen.  That would made it perfect for my needs.  It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.Overall, I would buy it again.[UPDATE 2-3-2021]I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm.  The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively.  I just added a screenshot.I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.EDIT:I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S).  This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me.  Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues.  Really happy with it.  I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.

Great for what it is
","
For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get.This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great.If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable ""S mode"", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google ""disable S mode"" and you'll find the steps easy enough.64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.

This is my third ASUS laptop and, overall, I am pretty happy with it.-Laptop is very compact, light, and easily fits into a bag or briefcase at about the size of a paperback composition notebook.-Screen is sharp, bright, and responsive enough for web, documents, and videos; viewing angle is a bit limited, but the 180 degree hinge makes it manageable.-Speed is satisfactory for documents, web, and video.  It's only a dual core CPU so it does floor to 100% often when opening applications or installing updates.-RAM is limited to 4GB.  Windows 10 idles at about 50%-60% memory usage; Linux idles around 30% usage.-The pre-installed Windows 10S is pretty locked down, by design, but can easily be unlocked from the Microsoft Store at the expense of storage and less security.-Storage is pretty tight at 64GB, especially if you decide to unlock Windows 10S and update with patches.  Luckily it has a vacant m.2 nvme slot to add a ssd.-The microSD slot is great for transferring files or offloading backups.  The card almost sits flush once inserted.-Keyboard is not backlit and should not be advertised as so.  Instead, there are white indicator lights on the Power, Fn, keys, and touchpad corner.-The physical build quality and feel is superior to my old HP Stream and other budget laptops I have owned.  The plastics are molded better, sturdier, and well finished.  The palm deck doesn't flex under typing weight like others do.-Charger is about the size of a larger cell phone charger and it's only a 1-piece charger with a long power tail so that makes it a lot easier to manage and store than the 2-piece chargers other laptops come with.For the fellow geeks, I installed a 250GB nvme and migrated the factory installed Win10S off the 64GB emmc onto the nvme ssd.  Linux Mint XFCE installed, encrypted, just fine on the newly vacated 64GB storage.  I did have to temporarily tether my phone to it to allow driver manager to reach out to the stream to install the wi-fi card as it's not included with the base distro.  Currently, no custom Linux driver exists for the number key feature on the touchpad so be aware of that if you want to switch to Linux.  I unlocked Win10H on the 250GB nvme I installed and now Windows has plenty of room to grow.  It's now a dual OS boot laptop that I carry with me all the time in my briefcase.  I'm very happy with this system for the price I paid and for the simple tasks I bought it for.

Excellent machine for price when combined with M.2 SSD
","
I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for ""M.2 mounting screws"" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for ""disk"" in start menu and hitting ""create and format hard disk partitions"".Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for ""Create installation media for Windows"" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search ""asus L210 drivers"" then hit ""support""). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 ""battery saver"" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.

Awesome lightweight everyday task laptop!
","
For surfing the web, checking emails, streaming music services, this is perfect!  Nice construction, lightweight and compact, and beautiful design.  I especially LOVE the inclusion of the USB-C port, which I will use to connect to a portable external monitor.  For every day tasks around the house, this fits my purposes perfectly.Update 1/15/21 - a few things - the product description mentions ""backlit keyboard"" but I can confirm this model definitely does not have it.  Also, the USB-C port delivers power to another device and also transmits data, but does not output video to an external monitor.  And I cannot get the NumberPad function to work, but maybe it's because I am keeping the device in ""Windows 10 S mode"" and cannot update the driver.  Anyway, for $199, I can't complain much about these omissions/problems.Update 1/18/21 - thanks to one of the other reviewers, I figured out how to get the NumberPad to work properly - you need to very lightly touch each of the numbers and they will appear.  I guess I was pressing down too hard.  So with that problem sorted out, I'm very happy with this laptop so far!!

BEWAREl, it seems as though ASUS has issues with ALL their computers...
","
This is my second ASUS this year.  And it's only March.  My first one I bought earlier in the year and it was expensive compared to what it can do.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it will give me the blue screen of death constantly, and I'm a writer, so it's always messing up what I'm writing.  Then my dog dropped it once off my bed and BAM!  The screen completely shattered.  So it's no longer a laptop, as I have permanantly hooked up to my TV in my living room.  So I got this little netbooky thing for writing and kept the other for gaming (Steam games only, as I don't think it can handle more).  And I've had it a couple days and now this one is also giving me the blue screen of death.  I cannot be without a computer as a writer.  So, now, I'm going to have to wipe this one and return it, and buy another brand, because I CANNOT have it just shutting down on me like that.  Getting the blue screen of death repeatedly usually means your motherboard or hard drive is breaking.  And both of these computers are brand freaking new!  Ughhhhh.  IF it wasn't for this issue, I'd give it five stars.  And I was editing a document when it happened, so I wasn't running anything crazy, nor have I downloaded anything but Firefox.  So it's not on my end why this is happening.  Must be an ASUS thing.

I confess I was hesitant about buying this laptop as a replacement for my old travel laptop of many years.  Yes, I read most of the reviews, watched the few available videos and, took the plunge.After installing most of the same software of my other and more capable computers, I was surprised with The ASUS L210M laptop. It is a really good and capable travel laptop in spite of the critics with very high expectations for a laptop of this price and those who are less fluent and knowledgeable about what is a limited spec'd laptop that was designed for basic computations and budget limited people like myself.Most of the critics within the above reviews addressed how poor the display is and how cumbersome the trackpad works to mention a few less important items. Keep in mind that the ASUS L210M was designed for close-up work and the trackpad works great with a highly capable number pad too. The display for video watching is also adequate considering that most phones and tablets nowadays surpass the L210M capabilities.The Windows 10 setup was flawless, the WiFi functionality worked as it should and the Bluetooth captured all the devices I have with no issues. I also bought a 256Gb small memory card to house all the pictures, videos, and other important files from my old travel laptops. Again, no issues or unpleasant surprises.Before returning the laptop and start looking for another similar one, I suggest downloading the ASUS application titled MyAsus that can be activated with the laptop registration. The application is very capable and adequate to solve most of the issues buyers have mentioned in their reviews and also to learn about the L210M.If you are a Windows 10 capable user, this laptop will meet your needs for travel, classroom, and budget needs.

Great except keyboard doesn't backlight and numberpad is disappointing
","
EDIT:  Ok, so i rescind what i said about the number pad...i guess i was hitting the keys to hard and not turning it on/off properly...so like i just figured out that you just barely have to touch the pad and to turn on/off you have to leave your fingertip on the on/off button for just half a second longer than you think you would need to...i think i will actually love this number pad eventually (need to get a mouse first- turning it on/off a bit annoying but you can still use the pad as mouse with it on but it gets hard to know what youre doing if youre entering a password for example and cant see what youre typing)Battery is great, overall really perfect for my needs.  Screen could be a little better but makes sense its a trade off for the long battery life.  What I don't like is that i thought the number pad would be amazing but it pretty much just doesn't work at all.  Also, I thought the keyboard would be backlit and it is not!

Great value for an internet browsing, word processing and watching video Windows small laptop...
","
You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing... Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics... It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the enclosure, plugged it into a USB drive on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.

I have always found Celeron processors to be the most reliable workhorses, and since I wanted this computer to function as a reliable little workhorse for the type of work that doesn't require 5 cores and 50gb ram, it was actually a selling point for me. The Celeron is as expected - medium speed, zero hiccups or hangups, mild exclusion from some of your fancier computing ambitions (compatibility).I bought two and installed Linux Mint on both, both run smooth, silent, and cool. No fans, an acceptable trackpad (I hate middle mouse buttons...I haven't found a way to map that thing to register as a standard left click yet..), empty SSD space, and all of the components registered with Linux Mint instantly EXCEPT the realtek wifi card. For that, you'll need to plug into a USB wifi dongle and perform a couple driver updates.So - I now have one in Mexico and one in New York, both of which I use to control CNC machinery. All is well.

Great Ubuntu Ultrabook

I love this laptop.  I got it for Windows but I wanted to see the performance of Ubuntu 20.04.  I am much happier with Ubuntu.  Things that don't work after initial install with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:  WIFI, Asus Touchpad (numberpad).  The Additional Drivers did not add the correct working driver, but both drivers/utilities were easy to find with a little searching so I have everything working so far.  I needed a temp USB network card to download and install the WIFI drivers.  Battery is amazing and suspend works with fresh install of 20.04  I give this a 5 star because I am comparing this with other laptops in that price point.  I am blown away at what a capable little Linux development box, I have been running PHPStorm and Docker.  Feather light laptop with silent running.  I don't game  so I can't really speak to that but for 228, I wouldn't expect too much.

Last December I purchased a 10 inch Android tablet. I'm not a big fan of using my hands to navigate a screen that size. I ended up buying a keyboard and mouse for my tablet. When I traveled I ended up carrying a tablet, keyboard, and mouse to accommodate my needs. It ended up too much to carry. I ended up purchasing this laptop and it is perfect for what I need. I installed a 128gb micro SD and it actually let's you choose the content that you want saved to the laptop or the external storage automatically. It Does everything I need done, booking flights, creating documents, online shopping, and viewing content. The screen is average, it's not the best but it looks fairly decent. Viewing angles aren't the best but you really have to be super picky to notice. Keyboard and touch pad work great. Windows runs extremely well on this laptop. It is very well optimized. I highly recommend this to anyone that has basic computing needs. You won't regret your purchase. I bought this used for 130 dollars. Best money I've spent this year.

9/10 a great laptop for under $200. Im a college student and needed a cheap smaller laptop for when I travel since my everyday laptop is 18 inches.

I do suggest you buy a headset or microphone because when I use zoom my professor/tutor can't hear me well, but again, this laptop is under $200 so I didn't expect perfection.1 year of Microsoft is great even though my school provides it for free.

I've had this laptop for almost a week and I really like it. This is the model with the Pentium Silver N5030 processor. This is not a laptop for gaming.

It will probably also be good for social media such as Facebook and Twitter, but I don't use social media.It does not have a fan for cooling so I suggest having a cooling pad. Also, there two Type-A and one Type-C USB I/O ports. I suggest getting a connector for the Type-C port that will allow you to connect Type-A plugs to it just in case you need it.  I will update if I encounter any problems.

This is my forth day using this mini laptop. I have to say that is has totally met my expectations and more! I do my homework on anything I decide to buy, this was no different. I knew that it was going to be smaller than a typical laptop. Yes, I was expecting a 11.6""x 7.6 laptop. I measure before I purchase(; No, it isn't a touchscreen. I bought this awesome gadget because I have a teenage son that I homeschool. I wanted a small laptop that I can use while he is on our main home PC. I love the size! Totally lite and portable! I added a Samsung 256gb. micro SD card for extra memory. I chose not to install the Windows 10 H upgrade. I will be using the Windows S that it came with. I'm not doing heavy duty stuff on this laptop. I'm not gaming or using it like I would a PC. I like to research, Youtube, shop online, take some online courses, ect. My son uses the PC for school, video editing, and gaming in our home school/ craft room, while I can do my own business on this new mini laptop. I am very happy with my purchase! By the way, I did install the free year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal version. It is worth around $70. The installation was a breeze! You must set up a Microsoft account, if you don't already have one, and set up a credit card for automatic renewal for next year. The awesome part is that once you have a Microsoft account, you can use the Microsoft office on any personal computer device as long as you sign in and download the software. Remember that the free version of the software that comes with this laptop is for one person (not the Microsoft Office 365 Family), although I think they offered that for free for 9 months instead of a year(: A great deal as well because you can add up to 5 family members for that account! I hope this review is helpful to you(:

I bought this laptop to replace my previous ASUS laptop which had served me well for eight years. They make a quality product and I trust this manufacturer. I use it for work and I have to travel from room to room in my building. (I'm a substitute teacher) its small size and light weight make it ideal. The battery life is great too, a big improvement. It gets 15 plus hours on a full charge. My other one only got 2 hrs. This is due to the eMMc memory, no moving parts as in a hard drive. Every bit as powerful as a larger laptop. The only downside is that it doesn't have USB 3.0 ports or an Ethernet port, but this is easily remedied by using a multi port hub that connects to its USB C port. (also available on Amazon). It comes loaded with Windows 10 S version, but it's easily converted to Windows 10 Home Version. I believe that this machine was designed with students in mind, but I see many adults using small laptops like this, so they're great for adults on the go too. I bought a second one for my husband too. He loves it.

Works great with the right Linux, with some installation finesse
","
4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is not enough for Windows 10. It will install and run, but slowly and system updates will eventually eat up all your storage. 4GB of RAM is even light for some Linux distributions. But I put Xubuntu, a lightweight Linux distro, on the laptop immediately before ever booting Windows. Out of the box, wifi does not work. It requires the ""rtl8821ce"" driver, which is on Github. Without network, this required downloading the Ubuntu ""DKMS"" package, in addition to the rtl8821ce driver, onto a USB stick and then compiling and installing on the laptop. Because this laptop has secure boot, it will create a key for you and enroll it in the laptop's firmware, which must be confirmed after you reboot the machine. This sounds difficult but it's not bad. Another reboot later, and you have a perfect working light-usage Linux laptop for just a few hundred dollars.Though this laptop is underpowered, I gave it a perfect score because for the cheap price it is a great value.

L210. Great little machine for what it is. Had it for about a week. Switched to Win Home and turned off/deleted a couple dozen stupid Win10 resource eaters. Turned off ""Fast Boot"" (always bad to have yesterdays mistakes reloaded, especially stupid idea for any RAM based drive). Only adds a few extra seconds to the boot. Updated to 20H2 with no issues.Swapped the Wifi for the Intel version (AX200) and doubled my ping rate (don't know why the original was so slow). WiFi will never be screaming fast with just 1 Ant.. Installed a Samsung 980 M.2 SSD (needed to pickup the extra screw (used M2x3 Big Head)) to offload installs/data and keep the ECC usage as small as possible (currently about 1/2 of the 64G is used). SSD is running ~1/2 it's capable speed because of the x2 buss limitation (only +$10 over cheaper ones at the time and I've had good luck with that brand). Formatted 370G of the 500G SSD as a basic NTFS data drive. Saving the remaining 100G to dual boot into 1-2 Linux, etc. OS, which will share the data partition as needed.Now has everything I wanted except the RAM. Would have liked 8G to run more than a couple things at a time. So far, Win10 is running fine with the 4G, but will limit some applications. 4G should be fine for most my Linux usages. Screen is a little small for my old eyes but I did want small and portable for travel usage (should be perfect for that). Build quality seems very good. Love the quiet (no fan) and heat does not appear to be an issue after the initial updates (very CPU intensive). Time will tell if it holds up getting bounced around over time.

A solid low end laptop
","
This is a well built solid low end laptop.  You should not expect much power from this system.  However for web browsing, watching streaming services (like Youtube, Hulu, Amazon), and basic office tasks like word processing, Quickbooks, etc this laptop works without issue.The solid state storage allows for fairly fast boot times despite the low end CPU/processor.  The two main downsides are the RAM and onboard storage.  There is only 4GB of RAM which is okay to start up Windows and a few applications but I would caution against trying to run to many applications at once.  Also I would watch my web browser tab usage and not open 20 tabs at once or something.Plus with the limited 64 GB SSD storage means you are not going to be installing a lot of programs.  This includes modern games.  This laptop is not a gaming a system.  Oh sure Bejeweled or something is fine but no way you are playing a modern FPS.This laptop is an entry level system which is good at basic Internet usage.  Think of this as a Windows power Chromebook.  It is also great for flights as it is small, has good battery life, and light.  This system fits a niche usage.  If you desire a gaming laptop or full desktop replacement laptop keep looking.  However for the use cases mentioned and/or a secondary laptop this could work quite well.

visual studio installs!

while this review is otherwise early, i thought it worth noting that the process of upgrading from windows ""S"" security mode and installing visual studio, and an array of hardware and software development apps has gone smoothly. i was concerned about the processor meeting the minimum requirements since i had little understanding of these new variable ratings - the geekbench rating is about 16 times higher than my old toshiba ;)while i haven't made sufficient observation of processor speed beyond use during setup, i haven't found any frustration with the speed of these operations. tbh i'm pleasantly surprised to have installed some older 32 bit apps such as synthedit and ones i wrote with borland's 90's fclt compiler and see them run without prejudice.the overall size is close to my aged toshiba netbook, except that it's light and quiet and probably tougher with the SSD. the pixels are so small i can hardly discern between them.i'm sort of amazed after earlier perusals to be able to purchase a functional development platform for $210. the only drawback i've found is that the keys and the work surface are all black, and the letters are thin, you can't see the key layout when its dark, i understand people are used to fancy backlit keys, i'd just recommend a colour contrast.lovely thing.

I bought this on a whim.  It's basically a Chromebook with an unlocked boot loader.  Identical specs to the Chromebook my kid uses for school.  I am pleasantly surprised by the performance and versatility.  I have it dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux.  I opted to take Windows out of S mode.  I also opted to leave Win 10 on the 64GB eMMC drive and install Ubuntu on a Crucial P5 500GB NVME SSD.Pros:Boot time is lightening fast on the NVME drive.  Still very fast on the eMMC drive.Very portable.Plenty of ports/connectivity  (HDMI, 3xUSB, microSD)Keyboard is still usable, if small (although the number pad is a bit gimmicky)great battery lifeCons:screen brightness and color isn't great (didn't expect that at this price point)needs more RAM and it can't be expanded (this is the real drawback of  using this hardware in a PC instead of a Chromebook)not a well supported wireless chipset (RTL8821CE)Needs USB-C power.Regarding the wireless chipset, it is *not* supported in Linux kernel versions < 5.9.  Which means it's not supported out-of-the-box in Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10.  I had to download drivers from github and compile the module to get WiFi working.

Those looking for the latest and greatest, don't bother. This machine is great for web browsing, document editing and such. I don't play games, but doubt it would do well.

Once you've installed that do the free upgrade to windows 11. Use the media creation tool and do clean install. I also flashed Google's Cloudready OS to a USB C flash drive and was able to use it from the flash drive without affecting the system storage. This would make a great Chromebook.  Overall, it suits my needs for web browsing and document creation and YouTube.  I also use it to test out different Linux distros.  At up to $120 used worth it, not more than that though.

How in the hell can speakers project when you have the danged thing in your lap?  My thighs completely block all sound.  So in order to hear certain things, I have to hold it up to my face.  Yes, I've trouble shooted everything. Yes, I know what I'm doing, and Yes, I'm sending it back.  SOUND SUCKS and I don't want to have a little speaker attached to the top so I can hear.

The only real complaint is that they advertise a backlit keyboard.  I read reviews before purchasing so I was aware of this.  Not a deal buster at all.Keyboard has a great feel.The touch pad number keys work great.It's is very light but feels well made.So far battery life is outstanding.Time to get a spare power cord.  If something happens to the original charger, I would be dead in the water.Also I downloaded as little Microsoft as possible.  Thanks to Google, starting up a new laptop is a breeze.  All I need is a little word processing, email, and web browsing.  Google does it all and quite nicely at that.  I am not fond of Microsoft at all.

Reason I bought this is to be used next to a microscope, so I can write reports while looking through the microscope. Screen quality is okay. Keyboard is kind of small but you can’t expect much from an 11 inch notebook. Storage is just for basic programs (Office and Edge mostly). The only small backdraw is the numpad on the mousepad sensor thingie.. it gets stuck sometimes but you can just get an external numpad or use the ones in the keyboard. Small size storage, but, is just a small lab/biz PC (bought a 128 gb flash drive to store reports)This really gets the job done. Def not something for gaming

I've had this laptop for a few months now and so far it has been great. It's fast enough, lightweight so I can take it anywhere, and easy to use. The only cons i can think of is the calculator location. I turn it off, but it's really sensitive and will turn back on while I'm scrolling and the side of my hand brushes it. It's definitely easier to turn on than to turn off.

Great Budget Laptop
","
Bought this laptop for my daughter, who is in first grade, to use for her zoom (online) classes and school work. It works great. Please realize that this is NOT a premium laptop, so don't expect anything fancy or outlandish performance. It works well for actions that do not require a lot of RAM/speed, like zoom meetings, watching videos, listening to music and basic school work. Having used Intel Celeron based laptops before, I was careful not to install too many software (that will only slow it down). The screen, speed and memory are adequate for my daughter's school needs. Finally, I switched it from Windows 10s to Windows 10 because 10s was too limiting/didn't support some downloads/didn't have any good apps in the Windows ""appstore"". It's free to switch from Windows 10s to 10.

I bought this laptop to my 11 year old daughter for her school works. It seems to be the perfect size for her. She loves the touchpad’s calculator option because she needs it for her math. I bought a 256 gb sd card to extend the memory since it has a card reader it’s very convenient to use. We received 1 year ADP which is relaxing to know. After 2 months of usage we’re really happy with this purchase.I am receiving a 90 days warranty extension from ASUS for my feedback.

I bought this laptop primarily for web browsing and it's perfect for that. I like the keyboard, and the numpad in the touchpad is a cool feature but a little strange to use. I've watched few videos but the speakers seem decent. The screen is...bland? Dull? So I don't know if I'd bother with trying to watch Netflix or anything, I'll stick to my tablet for that. That said, I like that the screen is a matte finish. It's very portable and the battery life is great. There is little storage space (most is taken up right out of the box) so I also got a ~$25 128gb microSD to expand the storage just in case I decide to use it for documents, photos, etc. It comes in ""S Mode"" but it is FREE to switch out to regular Windows so you can install stuff that's not in the Microsoft Store. I don't know why some reviews say it costs money to switch out of S Mode. Overall, I think this is a great little laptop for when I want to browse the web on something other than my phone.

Perfect for What I Needed it For
","
I bought this because I wanted a small,, light-weight laptop to do word processing on.  It's the perfect size and weight.  The keys are nice and hard (I hate soft keyboards), and I didn't realize this when I ordered it, but the touch pad becomes the number pad by touching the on/off square at the top of the touch pad!  The battery charged quickly.  I have been using the laptop for about 45 minutes now, and it's not so hot that I can't keep it on my lap.  My old laptop had that problem for sure!  I'm very, very happy with this, definitely recommend. I don't intend to use it for gaming, so I left that at ""0"" stars.  It's more like N/A than ""0.""

First thing is first, this is NOT a gaming computer. Second thing is second, that did not stop me anyway. I tried playing final fantasy xi on it while streaming from my phone. You can get the game to run on LOW settings, and it plays semi smooth. For modern games, do not even bother. Final fantasy xi is darn near 20 years old. Kiddos attempting to play things like fornite at 60 fps will be extremely disappointed. However, this is a speedy little computer for what it is built for. It has a nice design. Lightweight. Bluetooth (that one actually surprised me), built in wifi card, and actually runs pretty speedy for a little laptop. Every other laptop I have gotten this size in the past has been super slow, but this little guy surprisingly holds its own. Great for running basic applications and experimenting with silly stuff (i.e. trying to play mmos in your car while stteaming from a mobile device while utilizing its hotspot capabilities).

I ditched windows 10S for Ubuntu MATE. It runs significantly better because it doesn't hog a lot of system resources spying on you like windows 10 does.It's been a good workhorse, and will get me though the whole day without needing to be charged. Normal tasks like web browsing, etc run like you would expect them to on more expensive devices.I bought this a while back, and it cost a lot less. I don't know if I would recommend it with windows 10S at above $200, it was pretty slow, and the screen has horrible viewing angles (regardless of operating system).

This laptop is good both in its size and weight. I would say that that everything is fine except the fact you couldn't add additional ram (4gb soldered to board) you can however add a nvme ssd to it which is a plus if you want to dual boot or have more space, also I could say the TN panel is fine for this price range not a colorful IPS display but it suffices. Just don't expect to be running to many tabs or almost any game on here I would suggest to keep it light so booting it won't be a problem for the celeron cpu inside. I use it right now for college, and probably will use it after for media consumption. Oh and the battery life is great!

Older processor; wont be mining bitcoin on it, but exactly what I wanted when I purchased. 1 note - it does have an hdmi to connect with a better display.

The device was ok for about 3 months.  My only complaint was the lack of a backlit keyboard combined with the light colored keyboard that make the keys impossible to see in certain light conditions.  However, after 3 months the network adapter stated failing and I've been going round and round with HP support.  It is clearly a hardware failure, but they have made me do a factory reset which is a huge hassle and didn't fix it. After a factory reset that doesn't fix it you would think that the problem is clearly hardware, but they are making me work with another team to continue to try to diagnose it as software.

As soon as my Amazon return window had closed, the laptop quit connecting to the internet. I think it had something to do with the trial version of VPN software that was installed.

This continued until my wifi network adapter somehow disappeared. It wouldn't show up under device manager and I was unable to connect to the internet unless I wanted to use an Ethernet cable, which I did not. I tried every troubleshooter available to no avail. Then yesterday, for some unknown reason, it started working again. So far, I've been able to connect without resetting the adapter, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that it somehow resolved itself.

I clicked on the browser and viola -- the computer works.  However after shutting it down, waiting 15 minutes, I had to go through the entire diagnostics again to get it to connect to the network.  Sadly I am returning this.  It's my fourth HP laptop and I think I just got one that has a defect.  Even more sad is that there is no replacement for this one so I am back to searching for another laptop.  I gave it a one star overall rating because it has the described issue.  If it had worked properly I would have given it 5 stars.  I love HP laptops and will be buying a replacement for this one.  My other three which my husband and I use are all 3-7 years old and the work just fine.

The Camera/Video is Horrible

Well the camera is a big disappointment, very grainy.  States in the manufacture literature that the camera is 1080p; however, the highest setting found is 720, and less that 1MP for a picture.  I you plan on using this for any video sharing you will be disappointed also..  The machine otherwise seems fine, fast, good wifi speeds, ect.

Problems shortly after putting the laptops for use in our clinic
","
Two weeks after putting all business applications on the laptops for our providers to use during clinic they started having WiFi issues.  These are windows 11 laptops.  When I say issues both of them would not show any WiFi connections that were available. It was a sleep setting in the computer and one you can only get to as an administrator.  I had to change these settings several times before it actually stuck.  Now one of them won't charge at all.  This has been a real issue as we depend on the laptops performance and being able to connect to WiFi and to charge when plugged in, which are very standard operations for any laptop.

Buyer please beware: Wi-Fi/Wifi stopped working only about one month after light use
","
I normally don't write reviews, however, for the price of this laptop and the quickly emerging problem with this laptop, I felt led to share with other potential buyers of this poor quality laptop that is quite expensive for what you are getting.  The Wifi/Wi-Fi stopped working only after about a little over one month of very light usage.  This is unaccepted, especially for an HP product.  Of course the return window has expired with Amazon.  Beware everyone, this laptop has trouble finding your Wi-Fi/Wifi network only after about one months use.  Thus, in my humble opinion, I cannot recommend this laptop for purchase.  In searching the reviews now, others have mentioned similar issues with this laptop.  Amazon - please pull this defective product from being sold and having this same issue from happening to others, and give us our money back to those that bought this unreliable poor quality laptop ridden with Wifi/Wi-Fi issues!  All the best blessings!

The laptop itself is nice, but sadly now I know why everyone told me NOT to buy an HP.  Low quality - the stupid pile of junk stopped recognizing my wifi networks about a month after I purchased it.  Luckily I got the Asurion warranty for it and they can provide a refund, but I spent significant time setting it up and downloading things onto it, now for nothing.  And to think I used to live next to a large HP campus in Cupertino.  No wonder Apple took over the space...they don't build quality products anymore. :(

What is This Nonsense?
","
I was looking for a replacement for my aging Nexus 7 tablet recently because the battery is going bad and the speakers are now rattly for some reason. I really only use a tablet for streaming video, web browsing, reading books, and listening to audiobooks. A big part of that usage is video streaming. Guess what this thing is TERRIBLE at?At first I thought I was having internet issues, but all my other devices streamed from any source just fine. This device, however, kept buffering all the time. This not only happened when streaming from a source on the internet, but also just from trying to view a video from my home server.I then began to suspect the wireless connection. That *seems* to be OK but regardless of whether or not I used 2.4 or 5GHz, it would still have trouble keeping up. The video player would have to stop and buffer ever thirty seconds or so, usually for another thirty seconds. Simply terrible. I also want to stress that this was not from one particular app, but from various video players, YouTube, and Crunchyroll. The performance was so bad that this is the first product I have ever returned to Amazon in the many years of heavy ordering that I've done through them.While I'm griping about this thing, the touchscreen seems sluggish and inaccurate, with no way to calibrate it that I could find. Also, the speakers are in a really bad location - both on the bottom (side) of the unit, so regardless of whether you are holding it in portrait or landscape, you are probably going to cover them with your hands. Seriously, how hard is it to think just a tiny, tiny bit about how your product is used? I really expected more from a name brand like Samsung.In short: DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET. There is nothing special about it and it is nothing but a disappointing. A tablet from a decade ago would still be a better choice.

Liked the 2017 version better; can't recommend this one
","
This is my second Samsung Tab A.  Loved my first one, until I accidentally dropped it into the laundry.  So I purchased a new one (SM-T290) expecting the same performance or better. Unfortunately, the new one is a huge step backwards.UPDATE:  Don't buy this edition.  What should have been a great tablet was seriously misrepresented in Samsung's advertising. Even thought it has an SD card slot, you cannot move apps to it.  There is not enough RAM (only 2GB) to allow it to perform reasonably – even browsing the web on the Chrome browser is very slow and very sluggish.  It is not nearly as good as my 2017 Samsung Tab A.I'm also disappointed that it is missing features that were included with my 2017 version of the Samsung Tab A (SM-T380):1) My old tablet  had a USB-C port,  the SM-T290 has old school mini USB port.2) My 2017 tablet turned off/on when closing/opening the cover; closing the cover (a new one from the same company as my old one) on my new tablet doesn't turn the tablet off, so the battery runs out much too fast if I forget to manually turn it off.3) The front camera on the new model is only 2 MP (old one was 5 MP), and4) The new tablet at 1.1 lb is considerably heavier than the old one (0.79 lb).The new tablet runs on Android 9.0 (Pie), while the old one was Android 7.1.  So I did get an upgraded operating system. I'm not techie enough to evaluate how the Qualcomm SDM429 Snapdragon 429, Quad-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53, compares to Qualcomm APQ8017 and Quad-Core 1.4GHz on the old one.  I assumed that the new one would be faster but that's not been my experience.This does work good as a Kindle reader (if I can get books downloaded), but I'm having trouble getting my books moved to the SD card.  Urgh!Don't buy this if you care about performance at all.  I'd be better off with a Kindle.

There were issues but the seller did more than expected to resolve the issue... story below
","
I received the device in what clearly appeared to be ""used"" condition.  I commented to the seller and I was promptly contacted.  The device had no factory protection on it and the box was in an open / dirty state.  The device seems to work well but I was very suspect.  The seller contacted me after making several attempts to do so.  I was very busy but took the calls only to be surprised that the seller was reaching out to correct the issue.  The seller determined that the device was NEW and offered to replace it quickly and with more than expected service.  I opted to keep the device but was given assurance that it was and will perform as new.  I have every reason to believe them.  Without any hesitation, I will purchase from 6ave again.The device performs exactly as expected.  The device thus far holds a charge very well, displays very clearly and is working in a manner that one would want from a Samsung Tablet.  I own and use various Samsung devices from the Galaxy S9+ to the Note 20 Ultra.  This mid size touch device is exactly what I needed for the job that it will perform and I see every reason to believe that I will get more than I paid for when it comes to the cost of the item and the use it will see.

Disappointed because this wasn’t touchscreen. However, Customer Service and tech support is very good(tech read many test and confirmed it wasn’t touchscreen either) but still this is not a touch screen. They sent a replacement, swiftly and still wasn’t a touchscreen  but they were fast, paid shipping, paid return, paid freed pickup from home,  and quick refund. Other than that it was a nice computer but not what I needed. They shouldn’t advertise it as touchscreen though.  I give them an A for customer support and a nice computer but not what I paid for. If you don’t need touchscreen, than this can be a great computer for you. Looks like picture too.

PROs FAST. I searched and compared hundreds of laptops at the price range of 1k~1.6K and this one came on top 10% using cpu/gpu benchmark results. LIGHT. This is the ONLY laptop with such specs under 4 pounds that I could find. STURDY. Well, it's my personal opinion but it feels sturdy and well built. I like the way keyboard feels its click makes almost no sound and feels soft to touch.CONs It gets hot when gaming but is very well expected. Screen could be a bit brighter. Touchpad is placed a bit to the right. If you have big hands/palms, it might be tricky typing without touching it.To sum it all, I like this laptop and would suggest buying it.

I have not tried this myself, but it is something you might want to research before buying.The speakers are a bit more quiet than I would prefer them to be. I use a headset when gaming so it is hardly an issue.The fans are pretty loud on the highest setting, however I rarely need to have them on this setting.Overall I am very pleased with the laptop.

GOOD LAPTOP, BAD SOFTWARE MSI M15 Stealth *SCREEN FLICKERING*
","
Bought the MSI M15 Stealth and was impressed by the presentation, after booting up the laptop for the first time the screen started flickering, no matter how many restarts, shutdowns, and updating / reinstalling drivers, the problem was still there. I did find a solution however, by full wiping the laptop then removing all MSI programs and features (Bloatware)  the flickering stopped. I contacted MSI support and they had no idea what planet they were on, so if you have this issue please follow the steps above to actually fix the issue and don't waste your time with MSI support. The laptop is really good but the fact you have to do this is quite annoying, hopefully, they will fix this for future production runs of this laptop.

I am in love, this gaming laptop is one of the best purchases I have ever made, the screen quality is great, it's very fluid, and runs smoothly. As for all gaming laptops, they do tend to get warm so secure yourself a cooling pad and update your drivers. Dragon Center is amazing, MSI really puts out quality work, I highly recommend this product to anyone. Battery life can be adjusted but unplugged and depending on what you're doing you'll have a decent amount of gaming time or if you're doing work, school assignments, etc. Overall this is still a great buy, I definitely need to buy my PC after this.

Screen is nice. 144Hz, 1080p. Viewing angles are nice. Not much glare.Graphics card is powerful. Runs all my games well at max settings. CPU is the highlight of the show.If I had to find something to be bothered with, there's two things...1. No Ethernet port. It's wifi only unless you have a dongle.2. The speakers (located under the laptop), while nice sounding, aren't loud at all. Unless you're in a silent room, you'll struggle to hear basic things -- don't even try to use them for gaming.The battery is not bad, but you're not gaming while using battery -- and if you are, you know better than to expect peak performance.

FEATURES GALORE!
","
Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for & more than what I even realized.Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve & even has a dust sleeve in-between screen & keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.Upon booting first time & getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light & RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps & programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks & options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage & wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player & just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulationWith this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure & Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]Build seems solid. Got the Gray version & am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows & dragon center to as max as possible & lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]This may be The best ""budget"" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram & the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram & a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!

A One Month Review
","
REASON FOR PURCHASE - I purchased this laptop because my Dell XPS 8100 desktop kept freezing/restarting several times a day.  A fresh clean re-install of Windows 10 was not remedying the situation, and I had no desire to troubleshoot every component to see what was the underlying problem.  Overall, this issue was seriously affecting my productivity, as well as sanity.POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES - I was mainly looking for a desktop replacement - not a laptop.  I checked Dell, Amazon, BestBuy, as well as other 'PC build' websites such as 'ibuypower', but found prices too high overall.  Basically, the price was the driving factor for me in purchasing this laptop.  The final price was slightly under $1,300 w/ taxes, and I found that to be a fair price for performance ratio.MUST HAVES - Since this was my first PC replacement in nearly 10-years, I wanted to make sure I got a 11th Gen i7 Intel processor, as well as an RTX 3000 series graphics card.  I was looking for a RTX 3060ti minimum, but I could not find a match within my budget.PREVIOUS HARDWARE - My Dell XPS 8100 was still using the 1st Gen i5 650 processor, with a PNY GTX 970 updated graphics card.  I honestly would have gone another year or two before changing my PC, if these freezing problems were not there.FIRST IMPRESSIONS - Seems well built - I also liked the keyboard lighting.  Chassis seems solid, and I liked all the available ports on the sides.  The design was appealing, being perfectly rectangle with the lid closed - no protruding sections to put the shape out of balance.HOW IT IS USED - I use this laptop as a desktop replacement - I only open the screen lid to power it on.  Otherwise, I use an external monitor and keyboard.HOW OFTEN USED - I keep this laptop on for at least 8-hours a day.  It was purchased roughly a month ago, so it's been used rather frequently.GAMING (@ 1080p only) - It is a notable upgrade from my Dell.  Previously in games like WoW or FFXIV, I was getting under 60 FPS frequently in crowded areas.  Now, I get dizzy by how quickly the screen rotates in-game, forcing me to lower the mouse-sensitivity.  In WoW, I am constantly at 100 FPS with the occasional dips to 90 FPS.  I'm also currently playing Ubisoft's 'The Division', but the max I can get is 60 FPS with regular dips to 47 FPS @ medium settings.  Not killer performance, but a huge upgrade nevertheless.FAN NOISE - For everyday non-gaming use (i.e., web browsing), it is a low hum you can only hear if you're within 20-inches to the laptop.  When gaming, it can ramp up to a constant loud whirl.HEAT - Similarly to fan noise, heat is negligible for non-gaming use.  For gaming, it can get warm over time, but I use this product: 'Zimilar Monitor Stand Riser', to keep it propped up for heat dissipation.  It seems to work well in keeping this laptop cool.STORAGE - It only comes with one 512GB M.2 device, so storage for my gaming needs is very limited.  I looked at YouTube videos to see if it can be upgraded, but it honestly looked like a PITA to do so.  So, I have invested in external SSD solutions for space.WIFI – My router is roughly 25-feet away (through walls), but I get consistent download/upload speeds with the occasional dip.  No major connection loss or issues otherwise.BLOATWARE - It comes with a lot of MSi propriety software, as well as Norton Security Suite.  Also, a trial version of Microsoft Office 365.  I spent a good amount of time sorting through, and uninstalling a lot of them.BATTERY - I've only tested it off the plug once.  Even without gaming, it was eating through the battery pretty quickly.  I surmise it'd only go about 3-hours before draining out.  This laptop is definitely not recommended if longevity off the plug is a priority of yours.PROBLEMS – The only ‘issue’ I’ve come across is if I’ve gamed for a long period of time, or I’ve been moving large files around.  The performance of the laptop may drop significantly.  I remedy this by a simple reboot, which clears up the issue.  Also to note, this laptop has not frozen on me once.CONCLUSION - When I purchased this laptop, I considered it an intermediary, until I gathered the necessary funds to invest in a desktop with a minimum of RTX 3070.  However, it has proven to be a mini-powerhouse.  I don't play above 1080p, and I can live with medium-settings if performance seems to dip.  It performs excellently on non-gaming tasks, and I now have a mobile gaming platform if I want to take it to a friend's house.  All-in-all, I am quite satisfied with my purchase, and may now wait until the RTX 4000 series come out before I consider a desktop.Overall, highly recommended for purchase.

I've owned 3 laptops and 2 custom built PC's, and I've gotta say that so far this is my favorite computer I've owned to date. I'm downsizing from a 17inch HP Omen gaming laptop (that weighed 10 pounds) but it is in no way a downgrade. I bought this mainly because it's lightweight, portable, has a long battery life, and can put out when it comes to gaming (high to ultra graphics on AAA @ 1080p). In addition to using it for gaming, I also teach high schoolers. Using it in the classroom will be a breeze BECAUSE OF HOW LIGHT AND PORTABLE IT IS. Also it has an HDMI port for hooking up to your projector, and 3 regular usb ports for your powerpoint clicker, mouse and USB all at the same time (also has 2 USB-C connections). No joke, I'm in love with this thing mainly because I've never had a laptop this light and I'm excited to take it everywhere with me without killing my back.

This is a very nice and fast little laptop. I'll admit I didn't buy this for gaming. I bought this as an upgrade to my 7 year old laptop. I was going to go with an Alienware laptop I saw, but this one was quite a bit cheaper with a newer processor. I dont know much about computers, but this little guy starts up and is ready in seconds. My old laptop took almost 10 minutes to figure out what it was doing. Web pages and docs are pulled up in a second and basic functions are very fast. I like how I can change performance based on what I'm doing bit havent used that feature since it's so fast out of the box. It took a very short time to get set up and registered. I honestly couldn't be happier. I saw some mixed reviews on it and took a chance. I personally am not dissapointed. It may not operate as fast for other with more experience or as a gaming computer, but this works perfectly for my day to day operations. Very happy trying a new product and will probably be back for a second desktop at some point.

Great For Studying And For Gaming
","
As an upcoming college student who enjoys to play games but still needs a laptop to study on, I found that this laptop is exceedingly capable of doing both. Take this review with a grain of salt however as I am not really knowledgeable of the exact specs of the laptop and what the technical terms necessarily means. But what I know for sure is that this laptop is great for a combination of studying and gaming as 15.6' screen is the perfect balance between gaming laptop and a Chromebook, thus, not taking up all your desk space and allowing room for textbooks and journals, while still allowing for a comfortable screen size for gaming. The only true worry I have about the laptop is how hot it can get by just having the laptop in ""Balanced Mode"", a mixture between power saving and quality frames and resolution, near the vents. But I am sure this can be somehow dealt with either through adjustments, either through changing settings and another way. Overall, the MSI 15m Stealth is a great laptop for a student who wants to dabble in gaming alongside his studies at a great price as well.

A slim and discreet laptop you can play games on
","
Delivers on what it says.  Slim and light so it's one of the few 15.6"" laptops that I would carry around.  I like the subtle design and I'm not a fan of the looks of many gaming laptops.  Also, had plenty of power to play games (AAA) at 1080p.  As long as you're not expecting desktop power and 4k gaming, this will hit the spot.  It also does so at considerably less energy cost than a desktop.All in all, if looks are important to you, this is a great deal on a capable laptop.  Only thing I would improve (on this and almost every laptop) is a better webcam.

Portable Powerhouse

The MSI Stealth 15M balances portability and pure power. The laptop is really light for a gaming laptop, being under 4 pounds yet it has a RTX 3060 inside. For being such a thin laptop, the keyboard surprisingly remains at a comfortable temperature while playing AAA games. The laptop also comes with a thunderbolt port which is a nice bonus. If you're gaming while plugged in, make sure to change power mode to best performance and if you want a further boost in performance, you change the User Scenario in the Dragon Center software to Extreme Performance. You can also activate the Cooler Boost if you don't mind more fan noise.The screen runs at 144 Hz but needs a little bit of color calibration out of the box. This is a minor issue that can be fixed through software.Overall, this laptop is a great choice if you value portability but don't want to compromise on hardware specs. Thanks MSI and Amazon!

Previously I had an old dell laptop from a few years ago with HD disk and the difference in speed with SSD is very good. The design of this laptop is very comfortable and elegant. For the cost I think it is a very good option. The only detail that I have noticed is the webcam, which does not have much video quality. The size of the screen is adequate, it is not very large but it is not small either, so being a thin laptop allows you to travel comfortably. You can also upgrade to Windows 11. If your budget is not big enough to buy a laptop of 2,000 USD or more, this is an excellent option.

As an advanced photography hobbyist, I needed to be able to batch process several photos in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. This laptop filled the bill without breaking the bank. I’m not worried about the limited size of the SSD, as I ise a NAS(Network Attached Storage) for all my digital assets. Love it. And, sometimes, I also dabble with Xbox Halo. Lol!

Perfect Gaming Laptop

Since my job isn't as demanding this time of year, I needed something to keep me busy from the boredom. This laptop is perfect! I'm able to play all the games from my Steam library as if I were on my desktop. To be fair, almost all of my games can be played at 30fps on my old desktop with 1030. Power-wise, it does blow heavy but when you have a loud A/C in the building its hardly noticable. Definitely worth the money.

The specs, besides the intel core is amazing. I would have liked to the AMD Ryzen, but intel is nice too. The graphics card is above or equivalent  next gen, as the next gen video card is the 2070ti. The extra storage would be nice too, but it is easily upgradeable. Overall, the best thing about this laptop imo is that it looks like a normal work computer.

Amazing Gaming laptop for the price

After researching numerous gaming laptops, I decided on the MSI Stealth M15 due to it's slim, lightweight design, matte screen which helps a lot with glare and the internal specs. The set up out of the box was straightforward. It works well with all my gaming platforms (Origin, battle.net, steam). I'm impressed with the performance so far and love the backlit keyboard. MSI's Dragon Center is an awesome feature to monitor your computers performance and for customization.

TRAP : BUYER BEWARE
","
I bought this seeing the price tag. Seemed like a good deal. Got the product, after about 5 hours of use it would no longer turn on. I take it to the apple store a week later, it turns on when I get there, they run a diagnostics test: battery fails testing, charging ports fail testing. Does not turn on when we attempt to restart.K, time to return it. Whats the return policy? if you do not remove the accounts from the device, they can keep up to 50% of the return. Well how am I supposed to remove the account if the product doesn't reliably turn on. Why on earth is this my problem now?Several hours on the phone with amazon later, several weeks into the process, and after several screw ups from amazon's returns team, I finally got an assurance on my refund for sending the item back.Its not enough really. Thats my time down the drain dealing with all this BS. These guys have a 3.8 rating on Amazon, that is TRASH, and it was my mistake for not heeding that. A 4.4 rating is the AVERAGE rating on amazon, these guys are way below that and rightfully so. If you want a refurbished apple notebook that meets quality standards, you need to cough up the dough and buy through Apple directly. Don't give these guys your money.

I purchased this MacBookPro and loved it, but soon after I got it (about two weeks) the screen had issues.  It was within the 90 day return window so they accepted the return immediately.  I received my refund very quickly, and purchased another one from the same seller right away.  The first one was most likely a fluke, because my current MacBookPro runs great with no problems.  I purchased the protection plan, so repairs would have been inconvenient, but not tragic.  Hey, things happen--these are machines.

Despite I was hesitant to buy a refurbished MacBook Pro, adding that some buyers had a non favorable at all reviews when I was thinking to buy, I decided to try with this vendor Kanga and if any issue happens, to return it before the 90 days period.By now being the third day after ""unboxing"", the experience has been so pleasant, with the following highlights:1.- Speakers performs like sound bar systems, even better that some bars for TVs. I've been listening this morning a Pink Floyd concert in YouTube and i've found its flawless sound is amazing, much better than my 50 inches Smart TV.2.- It had MacOS Monterey preinstalled, and after a not so long update, I had the latest version 12.4, with all current patches.3.- It has a minor scratch on the back of the screen, and I won't see it when I put the case on the MacBook Pro, so I don't care too much of this. It looks and behave like new MacBook Pro, in a mint condition, despite it is at least 5 years old.4.- Coming from a MacBook Pro 2015, I'm getting used to the touch bar, however the learning curve has been no significant and I'm learning quickly its features. Touch Bar working fine at the moment.5.- Touch ID did follow its procedure to acquire my finger marks, so now its working fine too.6.- I believe those who mentioned bad experiences with their buys, however that is not my case until now.7.- I may think by a moment that I'm using a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro, without paying that hefty price. However when looking that the Apple support status it is out of warranty, so I'm coming back to the reality.8.- I found it required additional hardware to connect with my HDs with Thunderbolt for USB C, so having converters I did the first Time Machine backup with no issues.9.- Battery is above 90% capacity, with no cycles of use, so I understand the degradation may come because of the time and not by a previous use.I'm trying to use adding heavy workloads to the MacBook Pro in order to find any possible issue (like graphic card bugs), however at this moment the behavior is very good as expected.So I congratule Kanga to deliver this excellent device that I'm enjoying by now. However if something changes, I will update this review in the coming days, or to return it at the first failure.

Great computer with some minor issues
","
First off, everything with this computer internally is correct and exactly what I ordered. Battery is still fairly good with ~120 cycle count. Computer runs like it’s brand new. Computer even came with a brand new apple charger, which I was not expecting. However, in regards to the external part of the computer, there is definitely wear/tear/scratches even though the product description says looks like new. I am ok with the wear and tear as I still got a great deal on this particular model vs. other sites. There is a pretty significant and deep scratch underneath the screen next to the macbook pro logo. There’s is a chunk/dent on the left side of the computer base and there is a scratch on the back. Personally, I am fine with these issues just because I got an awesome deal but just don’t expect your model to come in external grade A condition. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase.

Piece of junk that looks like a good deal
","
Bought this for my wife who needed something with some CPU and basic GPU power for computing (small video editing, streaming). Worst piece of junk I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of buying. I'll start with the faulty motherboard ports, which don't work on one side due to the laptop most likely having been just thrown into a box and declared ""GOOD TO GO"" instead of an actual circuit check. Battery power is nonexistent even on easy processes like surfing the web. The wifi adapter is also garbage (-50 MPBS off a 600 dollar windows laptop). The screen is advertised as retina display but not only does it look like junk compared to a 600 dollar windows laptop from dell but the vaunted 'powerbar' feature quit working within a month. Charging is slow even with multiple chargers, does not hold a charge...contacted seller no response.More importantly, this is a mish-mash of AMD and Intel components. DO NOT buy this machine if you want any sort of satisfying experience. DO NOT buy this machine if you want a working laptop for more than a few weeks. DO NOT buy this machine even if it looks like a deal, because between Apple's faulty engineering and the non-existent refurbishment the laptop came with I would have been better off setting fire to my $1500 dollars. Buyer beware on this ""deal"".Worst laptop I've ever bought.

A powerful and versatile tablet/laptop
","
Coming from a traditional laptop, this is an amazing option if you want a truly versatile and convenient computer. I wouldn't expect to play games at the highest settings but for it's price point it makes sense.I didn't think I'd be using the touchscreen as much as I thought. It is super smooth like you'd expect a high end tablet.The keyboard is easy to get used to. I'm used to a full size keyboard but I don't really miss it so that's a great sign. It's really easy to switch between tent mode, tablet mode, or laptop mode. 2 USB ports is kind of limiting.The pen works really well. The plastic piece that attaches to the USB port is really cheap feeling and doesn't hold the pen upright (even though there's a hole on top as if it's supposed to) but it's not a big deal. Out of the box it doesn't seem to be as smooth as the lens like from the Samsung tab S7 plus, but I'm sure it just takes some messing with the settings.The battery life is really good. I'd say it's on par with laptops. You could get by almost the whole day without charging and if you need to, it charges pretty quickly.Overall I'm very happy with this laptop and I'm excited to work on creative projects with it!

Nice laptop; Be Aware of Battery Conservation Mode in Lenovo Vantage
","
I have only had this laptop for about a month.  Overall, I really like it so far and have had no trouble transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11, although I don't give this machine a lot of tasks; it's my travel computer and my bedside companion.I did have a concern about the battery charging, though, and I want to alert people to the issue. If you don't want to read this review any further, just please remember to keep the Lenovo Vantage software on your computer in case you need it.First, the laptop ships with a charger that is a small brick with a cable that has a three-prong wall plug and another cable that connects to the USB-C port on  the laptop.  I used the charger and the battery charged up to 100% with no problems.  I had my battery set to ""Battery Saver"" in the Windows 11 system settings.The laptop does have the older type of round charging port, but you have to buy a separate charger to use it.  So that's what I did; I went to the Lenovo site and bought that charger---which by the way, is not too lightweight itself, but at least it's more manageable for use on trains and such, and it has the two-prong wall plug.So last night, I decided I had better make sure the additional (travel) charger worked okay.  I noticed, though, that my battery was only charging up to 60% of capacity.  The charger was powering the machine, but the battery wasn't filling up.  I thought maybe the charger was defective.  At that point I switched to the charger that came with the laptop, but with that charger, also, the battery wasn't charging beyond 60%!  Oh, no!  At that point, I thought my laptop must be a lemon.  I downloaded an additional software from the Lenovo site, Lenovo Diagnostic Tool, and ran a test on the battery.  The battery test failed!I remembered that another Amazon customer who had reviewed this laptop had complained that he couldn't charge his battery beyond 60%.  A Lenovo representative responded something about a setting that prevented full loading of the battery to extend battery life if the laptop is kept plugged in.  I looked for that setting in the Windows battery settings, and changed my Power Mode setting to Best Performance, but that didn't help.  I could find nowhere in the Windows Settings to get the battery to charge more fully.Eventually, I looked in the Lenovo Vantage software, under More Settings, and found that my machine had been set (not be me, I swear) to Conservation Mode.  This setting is only in the Lenovo Vantage software, and is NOT the same as Battery Saver in the Windows settings.  Once I changed my laptop from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charger in Lenovo Vantage, my battery started charging again.The purpose of Conservation Mode is to conserve the life of the battery if the laptop is continually kept plugged in.  Because that's how I use the laptop, I will continue to use Conservation Mode, but will try to remember to switch to Rapid Charge mode if I want to take the laptop to another location without taking along a charger.I suspected that the travel charger I purchased separately had somehow triggered the computer to convert from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charge, but that is not the case.  If the computer is in Rapid Charge mode, either charger will charge the battery to 100%.  If the battery has a charge of less than 60%, and the computer is in Conservation Mode, either charger will charge it to 60%.  If the battery has a charge of between 60% and 100%, the computer is then put into Conservation Mode and plugged into either charger, the computer will be powered by the charger but the battery will not be further charged.I hope this review is helpful.

Misleading and Lacking MAJOR functionality
","
I did my research on the Lenovo site, and thought I was getting a laptop that checked all the boxes. I didn't realize that the USB-C port only works for power and data; NOT another monitor. I even purchased a hub that was listed as a ""compatible"" device. But, Lenovo decided to not have their laptop work fully with their own hub. I'm sure the other features of the laptop are good, but I feel like this is a major flaw.

Value for money if you buy at the deal price
","
The laptop works as expected. Performance and battery life is at par. I manage to work for 5-6 hours with full brightness and medium work load. I frequently work with 10+ tabs open with lot's of medium computation programming in parallel. The laptop pulls it off without a hick. Built quality is decent, the top panel could have used an extra screw around touchpad. Make sure you update the BIOS and Drivers. I faced some graphic hiccups before that. Consider Yoga series if you want a metal body and better screen.Pros:- Value for money if you manage to get it around 600 for Ryzen 5 & 16Gb. I did!- Comes with the Pen (Double check the listing)- Speakers are loud for a call, but not great for music- Fingerprint reader is very responsiveCons:- Fingerprint does not wake up the computer from sleep- No auto-brightness.- RAM is not upgradable- No space for 2.5"" HDD but you can swap the SSD- Average Brightness- Average Webcam- The cooling fan tends to get loud as there isn't sufficient clearance between laptop and table.That being said, none of this is a dealbreaker, and I would still recommend the product.

I've been stumbling along for a while with a six-year-old Lenovo laptop. Time to update. I've had good luck with Lenovo, so I searched and found this model.  ‎Ideapad Flex 5 14 Laptop.It's been 100% satisfactory for basic computing tasks. Email, web browsing, shopping and doing all the daily digital tasks you have.  It comes with a 512 GB SSDI. Get it with 16 GB of RAM. (The difference between 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM is breathtaking.) It is fast and responsive.Like most PCs, it doesn't have enough USB ports. Fortunately, you can get high-quality, multi-outlet USB hubs for almost nothing. It also doesn't have an ethernet port. I had no idea those were being phased out. Doesn't really matter; the Wi-Fi is quick and easy.Comes with Windows 11. Not as daunting as I thought. You'll figure it out.This can be your go-to digital device. Let it.Jim Tedford

Extreme bang for your buck
","
This is my 3rd Lenovo laptop and it does not disappoint! I’ve had it for about 2 months now and I am honestly very happy with my purchase. I am an engineer and a bit picky with my tech and considering the price, I don’t think you can find a better performing laptop for the price.The Ryzen 5 5500U processor is blazing fast and the 16GB RAM is sufficient to handle multiple programs simultaneously without a problem. My model only has a 256GB SSD (this model was on a special for $599), but if you are using the cloud it is more than sufficient storage. I even run an Ubuntu dual boot with 60 GB allocated and the remaining storage on the Windows side is still plenty.The touch screen and the stylus pen are significantly better than I expected. I’ve never had a touch screen laptop but I’m impressed with the responsiveness and the quality of the touch and draw features. I don’t use them very often though since I’m mostly writing software.I do a lot of typing and I really like the keyboard (though I am not one of the picky software types with mechanical keyboards complaining about key travel distance and such).I was aware of the low brightness screen (you won’t be able to work outside), the lack of display-over-USB-C capability (I just use the HDMI port) and the USB-C charger which eliminates the use of the USB-C port for other peripherals (I just use a small USB-C dock with extra ports), but I decided that for the price of the laptop, these are worth living with.One thing that bothers me a little bit though is location of the power button. It is on the side of the laptop (on the right side), and I’ve pressed it accidentally a few times while adjusting the position of my laptop, which puts the laptop to sleep. Thanks to the SSD I can get it running again within a few seconds, but it is slightly annoying.Overall I can highly recommend this laptop for someone that wants great performance at a low cost (but willing to live without certain nice-to-haves).

Great 2-In-1 for the Price But Defective Pen
","
I picked this up because I've been wanting a 2-in-1 to do some of my digital artwork on but also use as a laptop when I'm not using it for art.The processor is fantastic and can handle anything I throw at it, including some light gaming. I'm a fan of the design and, while it's a little heavier than typical ultrabooks, it's not a huge weight as I take it with me through my day.The two big drawbacks are the screen and the pen that came with it.The screen doesn't have a huge color gamut so the colors aren't super accurate but, because I finish off the color work on my art on my desktop later on in my process, that's not a major problem for me. The bigger issue with the screen is the LOW max brightness. It tops out at 250 nits which means it's close to impossible to see outdoors on anything except for a completely overcast day but even just using it indoors basically requires you to keep it at max brightness to see clearly.The digital pen that came with it was defective. I could use its passive features like basic drawing and interacting with the screen (just like you can with your finger because it's a touchscreen) but the pen wouldn't pair at all with the laptop or any of my other devices. I went through all the troubleshooting steps in the manual online and through every other troubleshooting info I could find after spending hours on Google searching for help. I made sure it wasn't a dead battery and that the laptop paired just fine with other bluetooth devices so, unfortunately, the pen was dead on arrival and the pen being included with the laptop was part of the value proposition of the device so where I would have given it four stars had the pen worked, I had to drop it down to three since that's $50 worth of defective product there.The laptop itself would work well for anyone who would never have to use it outdoors or in direct sunlight indoors as long as you keep the brightness at maximum all the time.Because of the low brightness and the defective pen, I have to give it three stars overall instead of the four it would have earned otherwise.

This is more of a 4.5 Star review rather than 5 complete stars.Bought this laptop for my wife. She previously owned old MacBook Air 11'' and wanted something with slightly bigger screen. When we compared, because of Lenovo's thin bezels, sizes of these machines are almost same, Lenovo is slightly bigger but as the bezels are thin, laptop feels very compact.Lenovo Flex 5 has a great design. Material feels premium, keyboard, touchpad, speakers are good (not great). Comes with Windows 11. Microsoft office is pre-installed but not activated so you have to pay for it. I didn't see it in the pictures but the screen fully rotates and you can use it as a pad.The things I didn't like:Webcam - its 2022 and 80$ phones have decent cameras, It's a pity laptop producers don't put better web cameras in their PC's.Second is the screen. Resolution is good, but the brightness is a bit low. Also colors feel a bit inaccurate a bit yellowish and washed out.

My 6 year old laptop was not holding a charge and started to not open software, so I replaced it with this one. I'm glad I went with the touchscreen model this time. It's light weight, and the screen looks great! It's a little smaller than my old laptop and does not have the number keys to the right. That's OK.There's a learning curve with every new tech purchase, and Windows 11 is a little bit different. I'm learning to appreciate the changes. Mostly, it's just learning where to look for things.

I am so glad that I went ahead an bought this. I needed a small portable computer that I could take to a number of places to work on ongoing projects. I wanted something that would be smaller, lightweight, have an attached keyboard, functioning USB ports and enough memory to be able to use multiple internet pages at the same time while utilizing OneDrive to create documents. I bought this hoping for the best, I mean given the price tag I was almost certain that I would be handing it off to my sister for my little nephew to play games on, but nope! Mine all mine!!! I waited to review until I had used in all of the capacities that I required and it has done all that I needed and then some! Super lightweight and handy, I can have it on my leg while balancing papers to review on the other while waiting for appointments. It quickly accesses the internet and has worked wonderfully in tandem with OneDrive and other internet functions. I could not be happier. BTW because of the extra USB ports (3) I was able to attach a remote mouse and it works seamlessly also. Did I say that I am Happy?!?!11/9/19 Wanted to add an update. Over a year later and this notebook still works fabulously! I find myself using it far more than my laptop these days because it is so versatile and lightweight. I have not once had an issue with it in any way. Not only woukd I buy it again I would recommend it to anyone looking for something similar!

Let's skip the part where we acknowledge the fact that Chromebooks, in general, are incredibly awesome...fast, reliable, can do basically everything you need to do unless you're a recording engineer or you work for Dreamworks...or if you insist on using one of the few remaining proprietary software programs that hasn't migrated online yet (hint: it's 2019...stop fighting it). Anyway, let's skip that part because you already know this and that's why you're looking at Chromebooks.We are now a 6-Chromebook family. Everyone has one now. 4 of them are Samsungs. I just purchased my 2nd of these little Samsung dudes, both from this seller, factory refurbs. Here's why you should pull the trigger on this right now:1. It may be ""refurb"", but they look brand new. And because of Chromebooks ""powerwash"" feature, they are fully wiped just like a brand new from-the-factory job.2. There's no such thing as a 100% never-fail piece of electronic equipment. So you want to get yours from a place that will have your back if it's not right. The first one we ordered had a problem with the keyboard. Keys would stick. I called the number on the box, got a native English-speaking dude from Connecticut, and he happily overnighted another one to me immediately, along with a prepaid return tag for the faulty one. The replacement worked perfectly and has been working for many months so far.3. As a laptop, this one is pretty great. It's fast, the screen is bright and clear, it's super light, the battery lasts forever, the build quality is high...and it just FEELS like a nice laptop.4. DID YOU SEE THE PRICE??There are down sides to everything. It's not as cool as MY Samsung Chromebook (the touch-screen Pro). But I could buy 3-4 of these for the cost of one of mine. I'm sure that if you want to burst this little laptop's bubble, you can open a million windows and see if it can edit video and print and browse cat videos at the same time. But don't be that guy. You wanna get silly with your laptop, buy a Chromebook Pro like mine. I'm still waiting for that one to bog down after 2.5 years of daily use and lots (and lots and lots) of international travel. For normal people who use web apps and email and edit video on WeVideo and knock out accounting on QBO and...for the love of all things holy, consider getting over the hump and using Google Office (and thank me in 6 months) this laptop is all you probably need. If it'll make you feel better, buy two of them and pretend it costs twice as much. Then you'll have a backup in case you forget and go swimming with the first one.In all seriousness, welcome to the world of Chrome OS. I love it here, and I think you will too.

The applications are limited and almost every software is based on google chrome. While you have the ability to install apps from Google Play, several of these are directed to cell phones and do not adapt 100% to the the Chromebook OS.The access to extra GB by MicroSD & USB is restricted, which limits its use and the possibility of increasing the poor 16Gb RAM the Chromebook has inside.It has a good performance and easy mobility.Microsoft Office is too basic, I hope a more complete version is offered soon.Regarding the otrher advantages, it is a fast and surprisingly light device.

Good Netbook
","
I bought this primarily for work but I actually use it more than my regular laptop!Pros:- The battery life is really good! If I use it strictly for work, I only have to charge it every 3 days or so. It can handle a Netflix binge easily and charges fairly quickly.- It is very lightweight so it is easy to carry around. This was an important factor to consider when shopping for a netbook for work.- It is made by Samsung and lives up to the reputation of good, quality productsCons:- Keypad: I find that I have to push dramatically on the keys, otherwise some letters may be missing from the text. I guess if it got really annoying you could use a Bluetooth keyboard but it doesn’t bother me enough to do so.- Screen: the screen is matte so sometimes this is annoying when watching things in the daytime.Overall, I recommend it - especially if you’re just looking for a small laptop to browse the web and stream movies. It’s a good “coffee shop laptop” too.

Amazing Machine!  Amazing Concept!
","
This is a fantastic machine married with fantastic concept; i.e., online operating system!  Here are the many virtues:  1.  Inexpensive; if someone steals it, you lost a few hundred dollars, not a few thousand!  2.  Works fast and efficiently for the most needed activities, such as checking email and web surfing.  3.  Operating system is online; this helps with speed immeasurably!  4.  Online environment has taken care of security and keeps it up to date.  5.  Long battery life and short recharge time.  5.  Strong bluetooth connection.  6.  Intuitive ""menu"".  7.  Aligned with Google, and let's face it:  Google is everywhere!!!I have been extremely happy with this ""system""!  I don't know if I'll ever go back, to be honest!  Instead, I'll probably just upgrade to a better version one day, if and when I start to notice any limitations.Since purchase, I've learned some things:  1.  Chrome stops ""supporting"" these computers after a few years; I don't know what that means; a computer geek would know.  2.  Chrome doesn't like ""cookies.""  This is probably a good thing from a security perspective, but there are some systems out there that don't ""play nice"" if you don't accept their cookies; Chrome isn't going to play with those systems.  3.  Doesn't support ""Internet explorer""; I don't know the politics behind it, and generally, it's not a problem, but, for example, the gym I belong to, in response to COVID, decided to use internet explorer to design its scheduling system; Chrome doesn't support it.  If I didn't have a work computer with Explorer, I wouldn't be able to schedule my classes, and I'd be in a real funk!All in all, these limitations don't affect me too much.  I'm not a computer sophisticate; if I were, maybe they'd  bother me more!  In sum, if you want a fast, efficient computer, where you can connect to all things Google-related, and not have to worry about viruses or updates (because it all happens online), and you're not a computer geek or videographer, and you want to do basic things like email, YouTube, and basic documents (for notes and spreadsheets), then this is an excellent solution!In closing, I can't wait to take this on travel with me in the Fall; no longer will have to be worried about my $2,000 MacBook Air being stolen or lost in transit!  This little machine's compatibility with the most popular systems out there means I can pretty much do everything I need, without incident!  I'm tired of systems (MacBook) that don't play well with others!  I want user friendly systems, and systems that are kept current and up to date at all times!  This machine; i.e., portal, gets me there!  Such a brilliant idea and concept!  Very appreciative for this innovative invention!

Next month, I will have had this Chromebook for 2 years; it's the very device I'm typing this on right now. I bought this to replace my very old Toshiba netbook that was running Windows 7 Starter. I used that poor Netbook until it just couldn't go on. It has been laid to rest in my electronic drawer. But I digress; I'm a writer, at the time of purchase I had just been hired as a copywriter by a marketing firm and I needed a reasonable fast computer for research and word processing. No bells and whistles were on my checklist, I just wanted something that could handle a lot of open tabs, word processing, and the occasional YouTube video. I couldn't be happier with this Chromebook! What's more is that even though it was refurbished, it came well packaged, and pristine. It looked like I had made a trip to Best Buy. I haven't had one single performance issue in the two years I've been using it, and as someone doing a LOT of research, I'm not exactly easy on the device in that regards. So, if you're looking for a computer for class, writing, browsing, or researching, then this is a great choice, and the refurbished product I chose was (and still is) fantastic. Oh, and it doesn't heat up like the traditional older laptops. My thighs really appreciate that perk.

This is such a steal for the price. I've had this laptop for a few weeks now and I really like it. The battery lasts for such a long time.

It starts up very quickly. It's ready to go within 30 seconds of opening it. The only thing I find funny is that I will X out of the website/websites I was on, shut it down, and when I start it back up, the websites will still be there. But it's a very small issue compared to the otherwise great quality you get.

Purchased 2 - Great Value, Brand New?
","
Due to the Covid-19, my children started online schooling. I bought 2 of these Chromebooks with low expectations. Actually, these Chromebooks appear brand new. I cannot see a single scratch on either Chromebook. In both cases, the battery functioned almost 12-hours, suggesting they are indeed brand new. I know that might not be everyone's experience and maybe I got lucky in my order. As far as a Chromebook, it is functioning flawlessly for my children's needs.Con: I am not a huge fan of Chromebooks. As a parent, Family Link is fantastic. However, if you are using this with a public school account, it will not work. You must use the school's assigned account and so you cannot use a personal minor family link account to oversee. I did not want to spend a lot of money on these computers, so I do not regret my purchase.

Samsung is definitely not the top brand for Chromebooks. For the best bang for your buck, you want an Acer. But for such a low price, I don't think you'll find a better product than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I bought it for my mom to replace her desktop PC. So far, it's working very well. Because she's using it as a desktop replacement, I didn't review battery life or the keyboard or touchpad or screen. I used them a bit and they all seem completely good, but I set her up with a 29"" widescreen monitor and a USB keyboard and mouse. On that last subject, you'll definitely want to purchase a 4 or 6 port USB hub, as there are only 3 USB ports on the whole thing. This is standard for Chromebooks, though. I did appreciate the inclusion of a Micro SD slot. That's another thing you'll want to get right away. I put a 128GB Micro SD card in there for my mom, as well.

I am surprised by how much I like this chromebook. My main laptop is more powerful but has very poor battery life, so I decided to get the chromebook to work on writing and online tasks when I'm on the go- you could work out of a cafe using battery power for several hours. I've seen reports that this chromebook could last 10-11 hours on battery though my experience has been closer to 6-8 hours, which could be because I got a refurbished model. Though battery isn't perfect it's been suitable so far and I'm impressed with the Chrome OS- it's quite fast and well thought out. There are limitations on the types of apps and software that are available for Chrome but for most tasks there is a Chrome OS solution. I like using the HDMI output to connect to a large monitor and have considered pairing a wireless keyboard and mouse to make it more like a traditional desktop computer for when I'm in an office environment. Once you pair with a larger monitor it becomes a fast/ simple alternative to the traditional desktop computer, and it runs much quieter than my other computer. Overall it's been a great addition that adds versatility and flexibility to my workflow though I might recommend a higher end model or different solution if you're looking for one computer to do everything.

This is exactly as expected. I knew what a Chromebook can and can’t do before I bought it. The max volume level of this chrome book could stand to be better. It’s fine, just at the right level for listening if there is not any environmental noise, otherwise it would need to have the ability to get higher. I have been able to have 5+ browser tabs open with no issues. After being use to a large laptop, the Chromebook did feel kind of small, but I got use to it quickly.

Basic laptop that gets the job done

For a refurbished laptop this thing has been awesome. It’s a basic laptop, which is all I needed. I haven’t had any issues with it at all and I’ve had it for at least 7-8 months now. Charges really quick and super light weight and small, so it’s easy to take with me everywhere.  The volume doesn’t get very loud at all but it’s fine because I just connect my air pods to it. Screen quality is again not amazing, but decent. I can get all my work done on here which is all I care about!!

My dad really seems to like it. He's been using an early 2000's laptop for years, which usually gets him pretty angry because it's so painfully slow. This little laptop has good specs for browsing the internet at reliably fast speeds. This is probably the most updated laptop he's ever owned, so it should last him quite a bit.

Fantastic device. After 6 years of the original Samsung Chromebook I decided to upgrade to the 3 for the access to the play store and I am glad I did.  I get consistently 11 hours of normal use on a full charge.  Typing is smooth, the track pad is very responsive.  Display is surprisingly good at this price point, audio isn't great but that's what headphones are for.

I am writing this based on the fact that this cost $234.  I see many reviews here complaining about the screen.  Remember what you have purchased.  This laptop is fast, light and well made.  There is even a good amount of storage for a personal computer.  Yes, the screen is not as vivid as a $1000 computer, if that is very important to you, buy a more expensive laptop.  For those who need to use email, browse the web, stream etc. you can not go wrong with this.  There is one USB port and one USB C port.  There are inexpensive attachments if you need hdmi or more ports.  I highly recommend this chromebook.

Im good to go as long as I have access to Google Drive and the internet, and that pretty much sums this laptop up perfectly. I like that I can open the laptop and click one button that takes me directly to Google Drive, which is very conviennent considering I bought it for my graduate program. The laptop itself and the keyboard are fairly small, but that works out just fine for me because I have smaller hands (hand size to laptop size for comparison). Overall you will get exactly what you ask for—I just wanted a simple easy laptop where I can work on my thesis without any extra bells and whistles, and that’s what I got.

If poor saturation matters, consider Grayscale
","
You will get what you pay for, but not in my case as long as performance & battery life concerned. If it comes with an IPS or OLED instead of a low-end TN screen, it wouldn't be an affordable one.A TN LCD panel has a narrow viewing angle, however, it features a much faster response time than the IPS counterpart, so a gamer's choice nowadays. FYI, WebGL Aquarium test scores amazing 60 fps with 500 fishes running on this Chromebook.The poor saturation is not so terrible but barely acceptable. If that matters, a less distracting grayscale over an addictive color display would be desirable. Unfortunately, a google system-wide grayscale option is not available yet, but as a workaround, a chrome web browser addon like ""Grayscale the Web"" does a great job.I appreciate they have tried to meet the least common multiple requirements with minimalism in mind.

I needed a knockaround laptop to take when I travel.  I used to take my tablet, but more and more I need a full keyboard and a close to full laptop experience.  I don't want to take my work laptop, as I can't risk it.  I've now done a couple of trips with this Chromebook - and it fills the bill.  Is the screen brilliant sharp?  No.  Is it lightning fast? No.  Does it do the job I bought it for?  Absolutely!  And for not too many sheckels.  I rate this a great buy and am glad I picked it up.  Wifi works well.  Battery life is great.  Recharges quick.  I've used it for web surfing, meetings, on-line documents, you-tube watching and movie watching when the hotel options sucked.  If I have any complaint it would be I wish the speakers could put out a bit more volume.

Value for Money

This is exactly what a $170 laptop should be. Tablets cannot replace desktop-capable devices for browser and file needs. This is essentially a tablet with more functionality in that regard. The commenters with complaints about the screen aren’t wrong, but did you spend $1K? $500? Even $200? No. You spent $170, and you received one of the absolute least expensive laptops out there. If you want a beautiful display, look elsewhere. This laptop does a great job for those who need more functionality than a tablet can provide, at the lowest possible price-point.

Having always used ""Windows"", and therefore completely new to Chromebook, it is a definate learning curve.  I feel hampered as I've only ever used Microsoft type computers and being elderly may have slowed my learning speed.I will try to update this review as time goes by.My old laptop was extremely slow and I was looking for something different and speedy.First impressions after having a Chromebook for 1 week:-It is FAST.  Pages load really fast!-It was easy to transfer all my data & settings from my old computer, thanks to using Chrome in past years.All my photos are there.  The Chromebook shows you how and guides the process.-The keyboard lighting CAN be brightened to improve key visibility.  This was one of my big concerns as many reviews mention it.  The key were hard to see due to the low lighting at first.  I didn't find a reference to it on the Chromebook at first and needed a quick fix.  A search on Google showed me how.  I followed the instructions and now I can see the keys very well in normal household lighting.-It is a learning curve to learn the keyboard shortcuts.  I am jotting down notes in a notebook.-There is a Chromebook simulator for learning.-It has a easy, sensitive touchscreen.-Screen brightness is easy to adjust.-No detectable heat output.-Battery lasts a long time.-Tablet mode:  Open it completely until the two outside surfaces touch and it is completely flat.  The touchscreen is quite responsive.- Any questions I have regarding how to use this Chromebook can be easily answered by a quick Google search.- The screen comes on instantly when opening, if I don't turn the Chromebook off.  Navigation icons are at the bottom of the screen.Still learning; will update.

At first, when I read and saw a lot of reviews about this device, I thought that I would buy a device that would meet the purpose, and I did not expect any further increase in any details of the device. On the contrary, I was a little disappointed before the device delivered .But the shock was when I received the device and did the unboxing ... At first, I was amazed by the shape of the slim device and its suitable quality for its price, but you may not get the same design quality in Windows laptops at the same price ... The screen is very good, the brightness and colors are excellent, and the touch is responsive ... The performance of the device and its speed is very good, and it takes seconds to enter the personal account from the shutdown state ... The battery lasts 8 hours with the operation of many applications and maximum brightness .... The sound of the headphones is good, not bad... I did not experience any heat in the device except for a very small amount of heat that was not noticed until I carefully checked it... In short, the device is more than wonderful and an excellent choice for a very good price.

After reading many reviews I did not expect anything other than a Chromebook. However many of the things that others seem to be critical of are not an issue  here.....  magnets stick when you close and open into tablet mode. The touch screen works great. The pad works great and the screen is bright. I have reservations because of the many negative reviews. So far so good. I will update you if anything comes up.Update: 7/27/211Backlit keyboard works great too!  I think that most people would agree that once you know how to use a chromebook there are few complications.  However, I still hate the way the cameras work.  Why are they sooooo bad?  It seems like this model would at  least off a better camera.. ....So I am disappointed about the camera and that I cannot use the blur background in meetings.

Almost Perfect
","
This is my first Chromebook, and I love almost everything about it.1. The speed is lightening fast2. It is extremely easy to use. I set it up & played around with it for a couple of hours, and learned a ton about the ins & outs of the Chromebook.3. A big 'Yay', on the lack of useless bloatware that is so common on Windows systems.4. The touch screen and mouse pad are both very responsive.5. The screen is crystal clear, and I absolutely LOVE the night time blue light filter. It is so much more pronounced than similar filters on any of my other devices. It really helps with eye strain, and you can use it during the day if you want as well.If I think of any more positives as I use it more, I will add updates.And now, for the one glaring flaw that kept me from giving five stars; The keyboard could be much better, visually. The keys are light, and so are the letters. There is not much contrast at all, so the letters/numbers are really hard to see. Luckily, I've been typing for so long that I can get by. But it'd be much easier if I could see the letters without straining!Since I love everything else about it though, I will happily keep it. I am good about updating my reviews, so if I run into any more pros or cons I will be sure to edit this.EDIT: I ended up buying a keyboard skin cover that fits and works perfectly. The item description of the one I got here in Amazon is: Keyboard Cover for ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 2 in 1 Laptop, ASUS C302CA/C423NA/C425TA/C433TA/C434TA-DH342T DSM4T DS384T C523NA Chromebook, ASUS Chromebook Protective Skin, Black

Great computer for the price

If you want a laptop with a nice-sized screen, 360 rotation, and touchscreen it's a great laptop at a great price. I've had mine for 3 months now with no issues. I use it for college and a charge lasts me all day until I get back to my dorm. If I don't use it much over the weekend say an hour a day then a full charge will last all weekend. The only downside is that the touch screen is capacitive and not active. If you want to write a lot of notes on your laptop and you can spare another hundred or so get the C436 it has an active screen. My notes are really sloppy and it's not the easiest but it works fine and I only use it in lectures to make annotations on pdfs and then take notes on paper when I get back to my dorm. I wouldn't use it for notes all the time because of that. But for the price it's the best all around for what it offers.

The ASUS Chromebook Flip C433 2-in-1 Laptop is aesthetically pleasing with the performance to match. It sports 8GBs of lightning-fast RAM with a processor that is equal to the task. The keyboard is beautiful and responsive, and with its vibrant back-lighting, it is clearly visible in any light environment. The 2-in-1 functionality really sets this device apart from its competitors. The captivating display provides unparalleled visual clarity and the touch screen is exceptionally receptive. Although all of these accolades are well deserved, it is the value you receive for your well-earned dollar that genuinely places the ASUS Chromebook Flip C433 2-in-1 Laptop, head and shoulders above all other devices in its class. In summary, this is a responsive, beautiful, and adaptive device that can hold its own against much more expensive laptops at a fraction of the cost.

ease of using a chromebook
","
Love how lightweight this chromebook is.  It was easy to transfer all of our pictures, documents, email accounts, etc.  Battery life is amazing, we never have to plug it in.  The only thing I do not like is that the keys are a shiny silver and the letters on the keys are very hard to see and they are very close together so I make a lot of typing errors unless I have the keyboard angled a certain way.  I also do not like the touch mouse pad, I'm old school and really like having a mouse.  That being said, after complaining for several days, my husband informed me that it is a touch screen so now I scroll that way and it's easier.  Good product for the money if you aren't keeping payroll, bookkeeping or major work projects.  Haven't tried doing any spreadsheets or graphs yet, this is mostly for entertainment, checking email and uploading pictures!

Good screen, disappointing keyboard and mouse

I love ASUS products, so I was really excited to receive this. Unfortunately, I've found this chromebook quite buggy and awkward. In no particular order:PROS:1. looks nice; sleek. screen is nice and spacious, pretty.CONS:1. Kind of difficult to open up the notebook.2. The keyboard doesn't feel that good to use, and I can't easily find the setting to disable to touchpad while typing. ): Maybe the keyboard is uncomfortable because I have small hands? But that was my experience.3. The touchpad does not feel good to use aaaat aaaaaaall, haha. That's not that big of a deal since I usually use a bluetooth mouse anyways, but there again, since it only has 1 USB port, you can't plug in a keyboard and mouse at once.Unrelated, but I was kind of bummed that this chromebook doesn't qualify for any electronics trade-in programs, so I'm not really even sure how to get rid of it. I'll have to make that a criteria for buying laptops going forward, haha.

Great chromebook but silver keys and white lettering are a horrible combination

I had the previous version of this Chromebook that had a black back lit keyboard.  I loved it but the USB-C ports died and I bought this newer version.

Pretty much impossible to see what the key lettering is unless it is a completely dark room.

It's okay but I think ACER models have this beat
","
This looks like a decent unit, but my first gripe is that keyboard is underwhelming, *not* backlit in any meaningful sense (manual says that it is), and the ACER Chromebook, or the Samsung Chromebook have much more tactile and responsive keys.  They also use black keys with white lettering.  Inexplicably the 433 uses silver keys with clear/impossible to read letters.  The keys are also spaced too close.  Go to a real store and try out an ACER keyboard to see what I mean.Next problem, though this applies to any Chromebook:  Not all of the ""Android"" apps will work on a Chromebook.  Luckily, there is a handy ""How to"" Geek's article for how to install Signal using the Linux tools that come with a Chromebook.  But I wanted to use my Chromebook just for financial websites, for security. Can't use a Yubico 5NFC 2FA authenticator with a Chromebook.  Not compatible even though there is a USB-A port you can plug the 5 NFC into.Third problem:  On a quick first glance, the outer case looks nice.  But then I noticed small scratches and nicks and this was just opened!  Either I got used model or this material does not wear well.Overall, I find this Chromebook cramped, it feels cheap, and it's a let down because my old Windows 8 ASUS Tablet with  keyboard was such a pleasant surprise.  This was twice the cost and feels worse in every way.  I so wished that I had purchased a larger ACER with  a nicer keyboard.  Really try to check these out in person at a store before buying.  That's my advice.

Very much disappointed with dim screen and keyboard
","
Since, I rated low for this ASUS Chromebook C433TA-AS384T, I wanted to go over cons first.The screen brightness, character sharpness, contrast of this Chromebook is really pathetic. I undertand the term, brightness is comparative, but I can say that with any % of brightness, the characters, screen of any webpage appear as if you are reading on a faded, yellowish news paper and not on a new white page. The other way to explain is, this screen resembles 4000K bulb (yellow tone) and not towards 6000K (day light) color temperature. So, in spite of whichever the brightness setting, the characters looks dull without good color, B&W contrast. This is extremely disappointing for $435 Chromebook. In fact the main point for my purchase was, this has FHD 1920x1080 display and expected the screen to be better than my 5 year old Dell 14 inch Inspiron 1366x768 laptop. But, it turned out that the screen readability is much worse.The keyboard really sucks with same grey color like the laptop color and the characters are hardly readable if you have some lighting in the room. This is very much annoying, but is tolerable with keyboard lighting turned off through Alt + Brightness control key. This seems to be a not good design of keyboard.There is a magnet between the lid and base unit which makes it hard to open the screen, but this inconvenience is also tolerable compared to dim screen issue.The pros are certainly it is very fast and has 8GB RAM.

No case that allows the ""flip"".

Love the chromebook. The battery drained a little faster than I had hoped, but it is fast and the flip feature that turns it into a notebook is awesome. There is a c-type input on both the left and right sides for the power cord which is cool.  There are even these great hard cover cases (like a cell phone case) that come in two pieces so they can stay on even when you flip it to use the notebook feature.  Unfortunately, you need to buy one for that exact model. I found out too late... so if you have a C433 model it won't fit a C432 model case.The seller doesn't make a case for this model that I can find anywhere.  If anyone knows where I can find one please post the info. I was tempted to buy another chromebook in a different model so I could get a hard cover instead of a padded pouch but missed the return window.  The chromebook itself is still pretty cool though!  Just don't drop it if you are using it while walking or moving around.

This Chromebook is fast, the battery is fine so far, but it seems the quality is not very good. Backlit keyboard is too dim to clearly see on a rainy day, but is ok in the total darkness.

It always gets into the way when you are picking the laptop, also the volume button is broken and gets stuck in the ""volume down"" position. And I have not even used this button.

Overall, this is an excellent Chromebook. Easy to use right out of the box. But there are a few frustrating design flaws. First, the left shift key was placed an entire row down because for some reason they felt it was necessary to put a random “search” button right where the shift key would go! So if you are an experienced typist, every time you go to make a capital letter, you hit the very disruptive search key and an entire search window opens. It’s beyond annoying and it really makes fluid typing difficult. I would never have purchased it for this one problem!Another design problem is how hard you have to press down on the touchpad in order to perform functions with it, it actually starts to be a big effort.Not looking for things to complain about, but these “little” things have caused me to dread using this machine just a few days in. Far from a smooth use each time!

I really wanted to like this. I bought this thinking Chrome OS would be similar to Windows. It runs more like a phone or tablet. The system is based on a Google/Gmail account (your password/login is your email and your password). This would be great for leisure use but I wanted a work computer. And after I turned it on, I realized I couldn’t install the Microsoft 365 suite for Windows on it. I’d have to go onto Google Play and install each program (i.e. Excel) separately and pay separately. Costing more and doesn’t have good reviews. It may just be too new for other programs like Photoshop to be available for it (I didn’t even look because it was getting to be too much work). Sadly I returned it. I really wanted to like this.If it was just for browsing the web, emails and watching Netflix, it’s a great laptop for that. It’s fast, incredibly light and the screen comes right to the edge, making it very sleek.

From the picture you can see I am writing the review on this computer right now. The little pink sticky is covering the webcam, if you were at all curious. It is a great little addition to my computer family and it makes it easy for me to do quick computer requests and work when needed. It starts super fast and it is really easy to use. I would say buy yourself a Logitech Bluetooth mouse and it will make everything easier. The only drawback to this machine is that it isn't a Touch Screen. If you can live without that, then this is a fantastic addition to your house, work, or school. I added a 128 Gb microSD card to save anything I download or any documents I create. This saves space for any additional applications you may need. If you have never used a Chromebook, think of it like a tablet that you can type on and have a regular browser to use. All apps are downloaded from the Google Play store, don't mind if it says telephone only, most of them work just fine. Just a tip, I downloaded McAfee Safe Connect and McAfee Security by T-Mobile for safe web browsing and doing my banking. Don't use a free virus protector, pay for it.

I purchased this because I am tired of laptops that run Windows crashing two to three years after purchase.  I read a review on this Chromebook where the user said it's a perfect computer if you don't have much to do with it.  And that description fits me perfectly.  It is a great computer for watching Netflix, checking email, doing basic online and word processing stuff.  Also, it is lighting quick on startup.  It's almost hard to believe I put up with Windows for so long.  This computer is very user friendly, I wish I would have purchased one sooner.  Great laptop overall, I can't see a reason why I'd ever go back to Windows.

Completely dead after two months
","
I bought this mainly for my kid to be able to do school stuff - perfect as the school uses chromebooks too, or so I thought. Since I bought it near summer (May 21, 2020) it was only used a handful of times. Yesterday (August 3,2020) we needed to use it and it was dead. As in, nothing. No power button light, trying to charge it no light, wouldn't turn on. NOTHING. There is no damage to the case, screen, etc., so it's not like it was handled roughly. It just won't do anything. I would not recommend this to anyone.

This is my first netbook.  Must admit, I was a bit skeptical after so many years with computers.  Not really being into more compute power.  This is far more better than expected.First.  It's much faster.Second.  There are updates.  But not as intrusive and constant.Third.  I can do just as much as I personally did before.  The more recent netbooks can be printed from.  Some may require some tweaking, but it's doable.Overall.  Very happy with this purchase.I've had it now for a couple of months.

USB-C to HDMI doesn't work
","
Update to my review: This wasn't a hardware fail. It was an operator issue. There are settings for the machine that you access by clicking the TIME in the lower right corner. From there, look for mirror mode.We're now totally pleased we bought this Chromebook.Initial review:I just bought this machine. I've got it mostly tweaked to hubby's needs. I'm adjusting to ChromeOS. We're both impressed with the speed and the screen. I would give this 5 stars, except... I can't cast it to the TV. I have a known good HDMI cable going direct to the TV, no switch. I got a USB-C to HDMI adapter. No go. Tried another new adapter, different brand, just in case it was a cable problem. Still no go. Both put the Acer launch screen on the TV, even when Chrome shows on the laptop screen. There's no mouse on the TV. I searched for any help, anyone else with similar problems. Nothing. I'll happily upgrade my review if I can find a solution.

I bought this chromebook for my husband because we just started homeschooling our middle schooler and we are doing a lot of research as we are about to invest a lot of time and money into a new farming business. It is perfect for using GoogleDocs, researching, watching youtube videos and creating and delivering lessons for our son. Web pages load quickly.

I first purchased a Toshiba chromebook in 2015, it is still going strong.  Decided to update and I cannot fault this Acer version in any way.  Display size and resolution is great.  The majority of chromebooks on the market are HD.  But this version is full HD, there is a major difference between the two.  Bonus is that it is complete with both USB A and USB C inputs.

Excellent Chromebook

Anyone looking at Chromebooks these days, and trying to choose one, is in for quite the ride.  So many to choose from, and at so many price points and feature sets.This is my first adventure into a Chromebook, and I did so because it looks like the OS is pretty mature now days, and manufacturers are putting together designs with great feature sets at very aggressive prices.Anyway, this is the initial Chromebook I chose to start my adventure with, precisely because it offered the correct blend of features and pricing.  I was tempted to go straight into a Pixel-Go.. but heard repeated reports of weak chassis and breaking hinges.  So I thought.. hey.. go with a lower end unit initially because that will give you  true view of the adaptability and power of Chrome OS.This unit fired up right out of the box, with no issues, and did all it's configuration and automatic updates within 10 minutes of power on.  Very simple, very smooth.One thing that led me to this model and brand of Chromebook was Acers has put a great set of I/O connections in the design.  You get two USB-C, two USB A 3.1s, the typical audio jack, and frankly that is about all I ever expect to need on a Chromebook.It was important for me to find a Chromebook design that was truly fanless (ie: self cooled), and the N4000 processor makes this easy and efficient.  I plant to use this machine in a variety of locations where dust, lint, etc is troublesome for most laptops with fansKeyboard response is smooth and comfortable.Unit is light weight, and for a 14 inch display, very respectable physical dimensions.  Chassis feels strong and rugged.Display is fabulous, being a full 1080P display, with plenty of brightness and contrast.The unit comes with ~ 15gb of the 64 used for the OS and other files right out of the box.It is fast, and responsive, and of course it runs the Chrome browser extremely well so that little Celeron N4000 series processor is working nicely. Given that in the laptop space these days.. the processor is likely the most expensive component... going with the N4000 instead of a i3 variant processor helps notably reduce cost/price.Battery life is superb.  I ran a test last night.. leaving it on with the display active and Chrome open on an active web page and after 8.5 hours, it still reported 6 more hours of battery left.  Of course with more activity, more current and less battery life, but this test overnight gives me a great initial baseline.There are still things about Chrome OS that can and will be improved, but this is true regardless of which machine you may choose.Time will tell how many years it will last, but at this price point it really is a disposable recyclable unit when the time comes.  But right out of the box, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.

I bought this as a gift to replace my bfs Toshiba 13334 chromebook from 2014. The Toshiba had begun to disconnect itself from the wifi on a regular basis. Power washing it did nothing. Since it reached it's expiration date I bought this to replace it. It's around the same weight but the screen on this is larger. Set up was very simple and there were no issues. My bf uses it mostly to surf the web and watches TONS of videos. Since I have not heard any cursing regarding the use of his computer, I say it's a win. He reports it feels faster overall and it hasn't dropped the wifi connection since he begun using it around mid November. Overall a great buy.

Mine is Ice Blue
","
While a great computer -- replaced a prior generation Acer 14 Chromebook that was four years old and still running mostly well -- what I did not expect was the blue color. According to the box, the color is called ""Dew Silver"". Anyway you look at it, it is blue, Ice Blue. Only the trackpad is sliver. Thought I was getting regular old silver just as shown on the screen....and nothing in the Amazon page or seller info said anything about a color choice at all, nor was color mentioned anywhere in the description. Luckily, I'm ok with the color -- it isn't obnoxious -- but still, it should have been disclosed prior to the sale.

I have the smaller Chromebook and have been satisfied with it as I use it daily (now in fact), as it's light and sits beside me at all times. The larger one filled my need to be able to view some files without having to manipulate them on the screen. Fast, efficient and avoiding the ""windows"" nightmare I used to have. Seems their ""auto updates"" wiped out 2 hard drives in past, but no such problem after going to chrome.The new larger version also has a faster recharge speed and uses the C style connection to recharge instead of the plug as on my older Chromebook. That was a weakness as the plugs stopped working after a year or so and required a new charger. Wish Acer has a way to change old style to new style charger port. 3rd chromebook, so very happy with system and product and price is attractive also.

I've had this 314 a few weeks now and find everything about it a joy. I ordered through Amazon US instead of Amazon Canada and got a better price--much better--than getting it in Canada. I did have a US gift card. On the first day, there was a slight screen flickering, and was about to return it but filled out a complaint form and sent it to Chrome--the flickering stopped--and hasn't returned. Just stopped. Feels so good to be free of Microsoft but use it sparingly when others need a doc in Word. None of those irritating Windows 10 updates.The Full HD screen 1080 p is good but not as good as my Dell laptop. But overall it's as good and lighter and nicer to type with as my backlit Dell.  I thought I would miss that feature but have not. I'm not into gaming but demand good visuals and audio for music and TV watching. This 14"" screen gives me as much clarity and enjoyment as any 56"" smart TV. The battery is a beast. Will it last?

With an old iMac and old iPhone, and unable to afford to replace them with expensive new models, I was so frustrated not being able to access most updated websites any longer. This Chromebook is the perfect, inexpensive alternative. Loving it so far. Easy to figure it out. So much faster than my old iMac. I'll keep that to store my 18,000 photos and Word files and use my iPhone as an actual phone, but use this for everything online. So much more comfortable to use this on a tray table pulled up to my couch, instead of sitting stiffly at my desk. Very satisfied.

Perfect Laptop For a Student
","
*Please note that I have only owned this laptop for a few days*So far I am yet to have a problem.  It has been fantastic for getting simple little tasks done, watching videos, writing papers, etc.  In my case, Windows isn't an important feature so Chrome OS has been a convenient switch.  Setting it up SUPER easy (I think the part that took the longest was setting up the ""Ok Google"" feature).  The battery life and charging speed is also exceptional.  The only inconveniences so far are that there are no keys for ""delete"" or ""caps lock"" (caps lock can be activated by pressing alt and the search key that replaced it) Overall, a fantastic purchase especially for a student.
